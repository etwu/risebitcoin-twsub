1
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:21,120
Don't be filming my passwords.

2
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:26,792
<i>I used to have a shirt in high school</i>

3
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:31,363
<i>that said "technology must be used
to liberate the individual."</i>

4
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,265
<i>And I didn't really know what
it meant for years,</i>

5
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:35,634
<i>'cause I didn't really think about it.</i>

6
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:38,670
<i>But today I look back and I'm like, "oh man,
hell yeah, I like that shirt."</i>

7
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:41,774
<i>I'm glad I wore that shirt,
'cause it's how I really feel today.</i>

8
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:43,709
My name is Daniel Mross.

9
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:48,047
Today is may 3rd, 2012.

10
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:51,984
<i>I go through college and watch
the Internet come</i>

11
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:54,286
<i>and all these different things.
And now, like, Bitcoin,</i>

12
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:57,489
<i>it's just a single technology built
on top of the Internet,</i>

13
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:59,124
<i>but it's so fascinating
because there's so many</i>

14
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:01,660
<i>freaking things you can do with it.</i>

15
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:03,162
<i>It's also just a big experiment.</i>

16
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:04,663
<i>There's no guarantees with it.</i>

17
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,434
<i>We might just all be wasting our time...</i>

18
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,437
<i>Exploring concepts and ideas.</i>

19
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,739
<i>It's at this crossroads of technology</i>

20
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:16,341
<i>and philosophy and politics and everything.</i>

21
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:21,747
<i>Just be a part of it. It's fun.</i>

22
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,482
<i>It's crazy though, but it's fun.</i>

23
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,452
<i>Um, first question is</i>

24
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:28,587
<i>what is Bitcoin?</i>

25
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:34,993
<i>I can't tell you what Bitcoin is</i>

26
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:36,428
<i>in just a few sentences.</i>

27
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,431
<i>It takes time to understand it,</i>

28
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,667
<i>the same way it took people
time to understand</i>

29
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:43,135
<i>what the Internet was</i>

30
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:45,003
<i>back in 1994.</i>

31
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:48,140
That little Mark with the "a"
and then the ring around it.

32
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:50,109
- "At"?
- See, that's what I said.

33
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:52,811
- Mm-hmm.
- Katie said she thought it was "about."

34
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:56,181
- <i> Yeah.</i>
- Elizabeth Vargas: <i>Oh, Internet is...</i>

35
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:58,283
<i- >- - That massive computer network...
</i> - <i> Right.</i>

36
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,452
<i>...the one that's becoming really big now.</i>

37
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,955
Allison, can you explain what Internet is?

38
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:06,492
<i>When the Internet was taking off,</i>

39
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:08,327
<i>I was in college at Virginia tech</i>

40
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:10,229
<i>studying computer science.</i>

41
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:13,165
<i>Looking back, it's amazing to think about</i>

42
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:15,167
<i>how much the world was changing.</i>

43
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,802
<i>Hey, Dan, ready for the game?</i>

44
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:18,971
I'm just finishing up here
with my new kayaking friends.

45
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:20,239
Kayaking friends on your computer?

46
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:22,674
Yeah, I just got America online.

47
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:25,210
<i>That same type of innovation
is happening again</i>

48
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:26,812
<i>with Bitcoin.</i>

49
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,514
It's the smartest people in the room

50
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:31,450
that are the most excited about this.
So what are they seeing?

51
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:34,887
<i>The Internet changed the way
the world communicates</i>

52
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:37,756
<i>Bitcoin changes the way money works.</i>

53
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:41,527
You can basically put a bank in your pocket.

54
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:42,794
Psst!

55
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:44,463
Wanna buy some secret stuff?

56
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:46,131
There is now a new note

57
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:47,432
that people are starting to talk about--

58
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:48,600
The Bitcoin.

59
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:50,369
The money of the future.

60
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,141
<i>Bitcoin was created to provide</i>

61
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:58,010
<i>an alternative to the banking system.</i>

62
00:02:58,012 --> 00:02:59,011
<i>We're in the midst</i>

63
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:01,146
<i>of a serious financial crisis</i>

64
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:02,681
and the federal government is responding

65
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,116
with decisive action.

66
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,788
<i>Unlike most currencies,</i>

67
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,958
<i>Bitcoins are issued according
to a set of fixed rules.</i>

68
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,761
<i>The idea was to create money whose value</i>

69
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:19,298
<i>couldn't be manipulated by
a central authority.</i>

70
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,433
The government, no matter
how many guns they draw,

71
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:24,336
cannot change a mathematical problem.

72
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:26,939
<i>They can point their guns at "two plus two,"</i>

73
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:28,301
<i>but it's always gonna equal four.</i>

74
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:34,379
<i>It's fascinating to imagine</i>

75
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,115
<i>what it means to have global
decentralized money.</i>

76
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:40,018
<i>And that's what's happening.</i>

77
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,454
My five-year-old's birthday.

78
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:17,089
First round of burgers is ready.

79
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:19,091
Second round is going on in a second.

80
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:22,261
First round of burgers is ready!

81
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:25,130
First round.

82
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,167
Eliza Mross: <i>Dan has always
been an idea guy.</i>

83
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:31,436
<i>Bitcoin is the perfect combination</i>

84
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,905
of how can I change the
world and make it better,

85
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:36,141
but how can I also be a nerd?

86
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,510
<i>So mostly I've just been supporting him</i>

87
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:41,013
<i>in this craziness.</i>

88
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,851
<i>Eliza and I met in college,</i>

89
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:48,086
<i>and we've been married for seven years.</i>

90
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:50,355
<i>We live in Pittsburgh, where I'm from,</i>

91
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,324
<i>and we have three boys,</i>

92
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:53,925
<i>I've spent most of my career</i>

93
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:56,628
<i>as a database administrator.</i>

94
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,831
<i>But for the past two years,
I've been consumed with Bitcoin.</i>

95
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:05,671
<i>Bitcoins come into existence through
a process called mining.</i>

96
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:08,507
<i>I build computers to mine for Bitcoins.</i>

97
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,011
I'm glad that it's finally
getting a little bit cooler out.

98
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,781
My wife won't be as angry
that the basement is so hot.

99
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,952
I've still got a bunch of
mining rigs running right now.

100
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:23,394
Actually they're right down here,
if you wanna go take a look.

101
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,232
Here they are.

102
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,937
<i>So what is Bitcoin?</i>

103
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,773
<i>Bitcoin is a revolutionary technology</i>

104
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:44,609
<i>that enables a new way to send
payments over the Internet.</i>

105
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:47,679
- -<i> You can think of
it as an open accounting system</i>

106
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,182
<i>where thousands of computers
all over the world</i>

107
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:54,119
<i>work together to track ownership of
digital tokens called Bitcoins.</i>

108
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:56,355
<i>When you send someone Bitcoins,</i>

109
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:59,424
<i>the transaction is broadcast
to the entire network.</i>

110
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:01,626
<i>After it's verified,</i>

111
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:03,161
<i>it's recorded in a public ledger</i>

112
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:04,863
<i>called the blockchain.</i>

113
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,431
<i>The blockchain contains a record</i>

114
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,600
<i>of every Bitcoin transaction
that has occurred</i>

115
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:10,202
<i>since the system began,</i>

116
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,170
<i>and it's shared and maintained
on the network,</i>

117
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,172
<i>so everyone keeps the books, so to speak.</i>

118
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,943
<i>Most currencies are issued
by a central authority</i>

119
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:20,278
<i>that controls the money supply.</i>

120
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,280
<i>Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer system,</i>

121
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:24,282
<i>so there is no central authority.</i>

122
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:27,352
<i>Instead Bitcoins are issued to users</i>

123
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:29,855
<i>who help process transactions
in the network.</i>

124
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:33,125
<i>This is known as Bitcoin mining.</i>

125
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:35,627
<i>Bitcoin miners are specialized computers</i>

126
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,295
<i>that do the work required to verify</i>

127
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:39,765
<i>and record transactions in the blockchain.</i>

128
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,533
<i>As a reward for their work,</i>

129
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:43,502
<i>the miners earn Bitcoins,</i>

130
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:46,805
<i>and this is how new Bitcoins are
released into circulation.</i>

131
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,373
<i>The system is programmed</i>

132
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,209
<i>so that only 21 million
Bitcoins will ever exist.</i>

133
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:52,778
<i>And as time goes by,</i>

134
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,446
<i>the mining reward decreases.</i>

135
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:56,915
<i>The result is a predictable supply</i>

136
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,617
<i>that's governed by scarcity,</i>

137
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:02,087
<i>making Bitcoins somewhat
like a digital gold.</i>

138
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,756
<i>It's the first currency of the Internet.</i>

139
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,591
<i>And everyone is free to use it.</i>

140
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,694
<i>With Bitcoin, you can send
any amount of money</i>

141
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:11,963
<i>to anyone anywhere in the world</i>

142
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,865
<i>as easily as sending an email.</i>

143
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,472
<i>My brother Nick is a filmmaker.</i>

144
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:23,608
<i>After hearing me talk about Bitcoin
incessantly for months,</i>

145
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,111
<i>we decided to start documenting things.</i>

146
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,980
<i>Hey, I don't think we'll
need the small camera.</i>

147
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:31,750
- It can't hurt.
- <i> No, I'd rather just leave it behind.</i>

148
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:33,819
I have so much equipment. Do you mind?

149
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:35,654
Damn, you really cramped it up, huh?

150
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:36,955
Not that bad. What do you mean?

151
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,491
- Jeez.
- Dude, they're right there.

152
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:41,293
Right in the back. Right there.

153
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,962
<i>I was convinced that Bitcoin
was going to be huge,</i>

154
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,598
<i>and I knew there were a lot of
others like me out there.</i>

155
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,167
Zipped my keys in my pocket,
so I don't forget 'em later.

156
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:58,243
Bitcoin was created by what's
believed to be a pseudonym,

157
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:00,779
a guy named Satoshi Nakamoto.

158
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:03,648
Invented in '09 by a fictitious person

159
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,784
named Satoshi Nakamoto...

160
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:07,786
<i>On Halloween 2008,</i>

161
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:10,255
<i>someone using the name Satoshi Nakamoto.</i>

162
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:12,090
<i>Posted on a cryptography mailing list...</i>

163
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:20,265
<i>The post contained a link to a white paper</i>

164
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:23,702
<i>in which Satoshi proposed a new type of
payment system for the Internet.</i>

165
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:26,638
<i>It described a protocol that used
peer-to-peer networking,</i>

166
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,241
<i>proof of work and public key cryptography.</i>

167
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,346
<i>For years, computer scientists
had been experimenting</i>

168
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:37,349
<i>with these technologies to
create digital money.</i>

169
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,718
<i>But Satoshi discovered a way to combine them</i>

170
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,353
<i>that had never been done before.</i>

171
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:44,789
<i>In doing so, he invented Bitcoin.</i>

172
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,726
<i>There are no records of Nakamoto's existence</i>

<i>On his profile page,</i>

175
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,964
<i>he claimed to be a 34-year-old man</i>

176
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,699
<i>living in Japan.</i>

177
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,536
<i>Although Satoshi Nakamoto
is a Japanese name,</i>

178
00:08:57,538 --> 00:09:00,405
<i>he wrote in perfect English
when communicating online</i>

179
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,847
<i>and went through great lengths to
keep his identity unknown.</i>

180
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,611
<i>Nonetheless, programmers and cryptographers</i>

181
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:09,948
<i>all across the world recognized the
brilliance of Satoshi's design.</i>

182
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,585
<i>And began collaborating with him
to further develop Bitcoin.</i>

183
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:15,820
<i>In October of 2009,</i>

184
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:17,589
<i>the first exchange rate was published.</i>

185
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:22,294
<i>Listing the value of 1,309 Bitcoins at $1.</i>

186
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:24,863
<i>Bitcoins were cheap,
and through the following year,</i>

187
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:27,032
<i>they continued to trade for
fractions of a cent.</i>

188
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,734
<i>In the spring of 2010,</i>

189
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,503
<i>a Florida man named Laszlo</i>

190
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:33,939
<i>decided to try using his Bitcoins
to purchase something.</i>

191
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:36,241
<i>He offered 10,000 Bitcoins</i>

192
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,276
<i>to anyone who would buy him pizza.</i>

193
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,011
<i>A man in London accepted</i>

194
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,680
<i>and placed a long-distance phone call,</i>

195
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:44,015
<i>ordering him two pizzas from papa John's.</i>

196
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,951
<i>This is generally acknowledged</i>

197
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:49,020
<i>as the first Bitcoin transaction
for a tangible good.</i>

198
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:50,989
<i>Bitcoin was gaining momentum,</i>

199
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:52,824
<i>but in order for it to thrive</i>

200
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:55,160
<i>the coins needed to be more
widely accessible.</i>

201
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:58,430
<i>A Tokyo-based exchange named Mt. Gox was</i>

202
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,832
<i>the first on the scene to take
hold of the Marketplace</i>

203
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:02,634
<i>and trading volume started to pick up.</i>

204
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:04,636
<i>By November 2010,</i>

205
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:07,138
<i>already 4 million Bitcoins had been mined.</i>

206
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,408
<i>And the exchange price briefly
spiked to 50¢ per coin.</i>

207
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,812
<i>The Market awoke and Bitcoin was
starting to look like</i>

208
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:16,815
<i>it might have real potential as a currency.</i>

209
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:19,651
His name is Julian Assange.

210
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:21,586
<i>Assange and his colleagues</i>

211
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:24,189
<i>collect confidential information
and then make it public.</i>

212
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:27,459
The release of 250,000
state department documents

213
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:30,495
no doubt presents a serious
dilemma for this country.

214
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,497
<i>Following a massive release</i>

215
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,499
<i>of secret U.S. diplomatic cables,</i>

216
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:37,068
<i>donations to Wikileaks were blocked</i>

<i>by Bank of America, Visa, Mastercard,</i>

00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:42,173
<i>PayPal and Western union.</i>

219
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:45,043
<i>An article in "PC World"
suggested that Bitcoin</i>

220
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:46,611
<i>could be used as a workaround</i>

221
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,413
<i>to send donations to Wikileaks.</i>

222
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:50,949
<i>One of Satoshi's last known posts</i>

223
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,851
<i>was in response to the article and stated...</i>

224
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:02,994
<i>Shortly after that</i>

225
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,829
<i>Satoshi disappeared from the forums</i>

226
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,732
<i>and was never heard from again.</i>

227
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:11,569
<i>Two months later the silk road anonymous
Marketplace was launched.</i>

228
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:13,938
<i>It functioned as an online black Market</i>

229
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,840
<i>for drugs and other illicit goods</i>

230
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,742
<i>and used Bitcoin exclusively,</i>

231
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,077
<i>because it made the money trail</i>

232
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,079
<i>nearly impossible to trace.</i>

233
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:23,148
<i>The silk road caught the attention</i>

234
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,150
<i>of New York senator Charles Schumer</i>

235
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:26,985
<i>who was outraged and publicly called</i>

236
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:29,254
<i>for a crackdown on the site.</i>

237
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:32,190
Heroin, opium, cannabis, ecstasy,

238
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,825
psychedelics, stimulants.

239
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:35,160
It's unbelievable.

240
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:36,961
<i>Throughout all this,</i>

241
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:38,797
<i>the exchange price continued to climb.</i>

242
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,099
<i>By February of 2011,</i>

243
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:43,468
<i>Bitcoin reached parity with the U.S. dollar.</i>

244
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,538
<i>Sparking an influx of new
users and speculators.</i>

245
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:50,608
<i>By June the price had soared
to a peak of $31</i>

246
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,811
<i>before it came crashing down.</i>

247
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:56,347
<i>As the Market tanked, the Mt.
Gox exchange was hacked,</i>

248
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,149
<i>further shaking the confidence of investors</i>

249
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:59,884
<i>and hammering the price all the way down</i>

250
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,986
<i>to the $2 range by October.</i>

251
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:04,923
<i>While Bitcoin enthusiasts kept hope,</i>

252
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:07,092
<i>skeptics were quick to share
their hindsights</i>

253
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:09,661
<i>and rants on blogs and in news articles.</i>

254
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:11,596
<i>Many thought that the party was over</i>

255
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,632
<i>and that Bitcoin was on its way out.</i>

256
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:17,235
I went online and I bought
one Bitcoin last night.

257
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:20,171
Really? It's the future.

258
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:21,173
I don't know.

259
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:22,174
It didn't feel real.

260
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:24,175
No. Real's gonna change.

261
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:27,746
Just watch.

262
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:30,081
Today I sent a total of...

263
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,685
2700 Bitcoins

264
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:35,120
to butterfly labs.

265
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:38,590
<i>I purchased, basically, a custom-designed</i>

266
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:41,493
<i>Bitcoin-mining supercomputer.</i>

267
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:43,228
If Bitcoin fails...

268
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,231
Everything I have is worthless.

269
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:48,800
The Bitcoins I have,

270
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:50,568
the computers, the mining system

271
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,170
was all a waste of money.

272
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,575
But if it succeeds, then...

273
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,313
It will have been worth it, I think.

274
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:05,650
- -<i> The Bitcoin economy
was a wild west in cyberspace</i>

275
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:08,853
<i>that was very attractive to
hackers and scammers.</i>

276
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:12,323
<i>Over the years, tens of thousands
of coins had been stolen</i>

277
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,626
<i>and 2012 proved no different.</i>

278
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:17,295
<i>Users had to be careful.</i>

279
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,098
If somebody steals your Bitcoins,
there are no consumer protections.

280
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,300
Sorry, they're gone.
You lost your Bitcoins? They're gone

281
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,102
and you're not going to get them back.

282
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:27,005
<i>But after months of stagnation
on the exchanges,</i>

283
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:29,474
<i>the Bitcoin price was on the rise again.</i>

284
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:32,844
The price of Bitcoin today
is around $7 U.S.D.,

285
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:36,347
which just had a nice little bump this week.

286
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:39,350
<i>By the end of the year,
the blogging site Wordpress</i>

287
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:42,320
<i>announced it would start accepting
Bitcoin payments.</i>

288
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:45,089
<i>And in early 2013,
the discussion forum Reddit</i>

289
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:46,925
<i>also announced Bitcoin support.</i>

290
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:50,228
<i>They were the first major sites
to incorporate Bitcoin,</i>

291
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,463
<i>and these milestones signaled the beginning</i>

292
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:53,898
<i>of mainstream acceptance.</i>

293
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,109
Bitcoin is the most subversive
technology on the planet.

294
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:08,046
This is a system that is growing
around the entire world.

295
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:11,282
So if it works, if this
experiment continues to grow,

296
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:14,652
it doesn't just help a few of us
in this state or in the country,

297
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:16,621
but it actually helps
everyone around the world.

298
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:22,493
<i>As the Bitcoin price hovered around</i>

299
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:25,396
<i>it's previous all-time high of $31,</i>

300
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:28,099
<i>I visited a libertarian conference
in New Hampshire.</i>

301
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:30,602
It lost 20% and then it gained 20%

302
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:32,437
in 20 minutes.

303
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,005
It is-- They're silly.

304
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,674
<i>Libertarians are among</i>

305
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,276
<i>the earliest adopters of Bitcoin.</i>

306
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:40,845
<i>Its nature as a currency
that isn't controlled</i>

307
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:43,815
<i>by central banks makes it
attractive to this community.</i>

308
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:46,150
Once I was able to kind
of grok the basic concept,

309
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:48,853
it was like, "this is the perfect money."

310
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:51,522
<i>This is what a Bitcoin address looks like.</i>

311
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:53,825
<i>Think of this long string of characters</i>

312
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:56,294
<i>as an account number where your
Bitcoins are stored.</i>

313
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:58,329
<i>When you send or receive Bitcoins,</i>

314
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:00,798
<i>they are sent to these addresses.</i>

315
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,834
<i>The addresses are long and hard to remember</i>

316
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:05,637
<i>so using a phone to scan a Q.R. Code</i>

317
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,805
<i>is a fast and easy way to read them.</i>

318
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,540
<i>Another good thing to know</i>

319
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:10,975
<i>is that Bitcoins can be broken down</i>

320
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:12,677
<i>to eight decimal places.</i>

321
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:15,280
<i>This means that you can send
fractions of a Bitcoin.</i>

322
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:18,683
<i>So any amount of money can be represented.</i>

323
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:21,920
<i>With Bitcoin, every transaction is public.</i>

324
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:24,422
<i>Everyone can see the amount
that is being sent</i>

325
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,892
<i>without necessarily knowing the
identity of the sender.</i>

326
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:30,929
<i>These guys even have one of
the first Bitcoin ATMs.</i>

327
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:34,132
You just scan your Q.R. Code on your phone,

328
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:36,401
<i>put in the dollar bills and
press the button.</i>

329
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:38,937
Bam. Done. Perfect.

330
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:41,306
<i>You now traded your worthless piece of paper</i>

331
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:43,274
<i>for real currency.</i>

332
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,310
It's like, "end the fed?" It's like,
seriously, you think

333
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:46,744
you're gonna end the fed?
You're not gonna end the fed.

334
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:48,079
You're not gonna change
anything about the fed.

335
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,114
- Transcend the fed.
- Bypass the fed.

336
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,916
- Right, yeah.
- That's what you should do.

337
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:54,919
My concern is how the
governments will react.

338
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:57,255
They can't kill or stop Bitcoin,

339
00:15:57,257 --> 00:16:00,658
but they could impede it and they could
get in the way of its development.

340
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,931
<i>A few weeks later across the ocean,</i>

341
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:09,167
<i>a financial crisis was reaching
a breaking point</i>

342
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,802
<i>on the island of Cyprus.</i>

343
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,137
Cyprus is on the brink of going bust.

344
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,273
The rest of Europe has agreed to a bailout,

345
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:19,277
but only if Cyprus raids people's
bank accounts for quick hard cash.

346
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,779
<i>People tried to get money out
of the cash machines</i>

347
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:24,115
<i>but electronic transfers have been stopped.</i>

348
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:26,351
Never did I think
that they would...

349
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:28,119
...in a completely unprecedented manner

350
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:29,954
resort to stealing money

351
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:32,323
from people's bank accounts.

352
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,225
<i>The Cypriots had placed their trust</i>

353
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:37,996
<i>in the banking system and
it had failed them.</i>

354
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:41,332
<i>As news of the crisis spread
around the world,</i>

355
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,468
<i>Bitcoin believers were quick to point it out</i>

356
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,436
<i>as an example of why a currency</i>

357
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,505
<i>free from government control was needed.</i>

358
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,941
There's actually Bitcoin ATMs

359
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:52,310
apparently being set up in Cyprus.

360
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:54,312
<i>All of a sudden, Bitcoin looks</i>

361
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,014
<i>like an attractive prospect.</i>

362
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,817
<i>While this was happening in Cyprus,</i>

363
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,586
<i>regulators at the U.S. treasury</i>

364
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:04,222
<i>weighed in on Bitcoin.</i>

365
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:07,692
<i>The financial crimes enforcement network,
known as FinCEN,</i>

366
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,762
<i>issued its first regulatory guidance
on virtual currencies.</i>

367
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,965
<i>The guidance implied that Bitcoin,</i>

368
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:16,200
<i>in and of itself, was not illegal.</i>

369
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,573
<i>It was the perfect storm.</i>

370
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:25,043
<i>The situation in Cyprus suggested</i>

371
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,912
<i>that Bitcoin could function as
a financial safe haven.</i>

372
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:30,481
<i>And the approving nod of U.S. regulators</i>

373
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:32,583
<i>was a green light for investors.</i>

374
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:34,252
<i>The Market agreed</i>

375
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:36,421
<i>and the exchange price continued to climb.</i>

376
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:41,926
It's moving from the super
super-early-adopter phase

377
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,661
to possibly the early-adopter phase.

378
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:44,962
<i>Bitcoin was getting</i>

379
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:46,664
<i>international exposure</i>

380
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,633
<i>and people were starting to pay attention.</i>

381
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:55,473
<i>This is actually a live,
updated map of the globe</i>

382
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:59,343
<i>and the lines represent Bitcoin clients.</i>

383
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:01,646
<i>Basically where the Bitcoin
software is running.</i>

384
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:05,483
And the length of the line determines

385
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:07,819
how long it's been online
or how active it's been.

386
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:09,654
And every time I look at this,

387
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:11,923
I swear it gets more and more saturated.

388
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:14,258
You can almost see an
outline of the U.S. now.

389
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,260
South America-- You're starting to get it.

390
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,029
But the big news, in my opinion,

391
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:19,864
<i>is this-- China.</i>

392
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:23,301
<i>You used to see one, two, three, maybe.</i>

393
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:27,638
<i>And this is all within the
last three weeks or so.</i>

394
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,007
<i>That's the most I've ever seen in China.</i>

395
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:32,176
Look down here. Indonesia, Singapore,

396
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:33,744
Australia, New Zealand.

397
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,255
<i>The following week it snowed in Pittsburg.</i>

398
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:47,725
<i>I was eagerly awaiting the delivery
of two Avalon ASICs,</i>

399
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:49,494
<i>state of the art computers</i>

400
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:52,597
<i>with chips specifically designed
for mining Bitcoins.</i>

401
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,298
<i>Yifu Guo is at the forefront</i>

402
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,267
<i>of the new generation of hardware,</i>

403
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:57,735
<i>and is the first to bring them to Market.</i>

404
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:59,670
Everybody, including myself,

405
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:00,972
had severely underestimated

406
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,907
the mining Market and how big it is.

407
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:04,275
<i>When Bitcoin began,</i>

408
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:06,410
<i>a standard laptop was powerful enough</i>

409
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:09,113
<i>to mine hundreds of Bitcoins
in a matter of days.</i>

410
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:12,817
<i>The technology evolved rapidly over
the past couple of years.</i>

411
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,652
A lot of people are getting into it

412
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,154
or still trying to catch up.

413
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,992
<i>I was on vacation with my family</i>

414
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:23,161
<i>when the new miners were
scheduled to arrive.</i>

415
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:26,430
<i>The price of Bitcoin had rocketed to $77</i>

416
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,966
<i>so I asked some friends to wait at my house</i>

417
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:30,501
<i>to get them running as soon as possible.</i>

418
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:34,138
<i>All right! </i>

419
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,660
- I hope this is good. I hope it's worthwhile.
- Oh, definitely.

420
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,477
These are new computer parts here...

421
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,445
- Excellent, excellent.
- ...Fresh in from China.

422
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:44,315
- - All right, it's
not official until you sign.

423
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,017
There we go.

424
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,421
<i>Yeah, we'll see. Maybe down the road</i>

425
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:51,956
<i>you guys will start accepting
Bitcoin one day, I bet.</i>

426
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,591
- That's cool.
- <i> Just a matter of time.</i>

427
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:55,233
<i>Good luck to you guys. All right.</i>

428
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:57,929
<i>I notified Dan</i>

429
00:19:57,931 --> 00:19:59,331
<i>and he has a little response here.</i>

430
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,511
Welcome to the financial renaissance.

431
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,781
192.168.1.140.

432
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:18,683
255.255.255.0.

433
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:20,685
192.168.1.1.

434
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:22,520
That's the default gateway.

435
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:26,591
My first pull is gonna be stratum.
ozc.in, port 3333.

436
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:29,026
Port 80, but I can do 3333.

437
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:31,596
<i>And when everything's all said and done,
for at least a little while,</i>

438
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:34,932
it should be pulling in
10 to 12 coins a day.

439
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:37,368
That's gonna change though,
after another week.

440
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,303
It's gonna get dropped down to, like, eight,

441
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:41,606
- just because the difficulty's just going through the roof.
- Yeah.

442
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:43,040
Everybody's firing these things up,

443
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,742
so it's always a race to stay ahead

444
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:48,112
<i>and try to be the first guy with
the hardware, you know?</i>

445
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:50,214
Oh, I'm getting pings. Whoo!

446
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:51,916
<i>Yup, we're kicking.</i>

447
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,317
We are accepting shares.

448
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,418
It is live.

449
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,754
<i>We've got the Merlot!</i>

450
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,463
<i>Hey, that looks like Johan.</i>

451
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:08,633
Say, "I'm going to college
'cause my dad mines Bitcoins."

452
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:11,435
Dad going Bitcoins.

453
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:20,311
<i>So, big day today, huh?</i>

454
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:22,847
Big day. Look at that. 104.

455
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:25,182
Current Bitcoin price. Broke 100 today.

456
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:28,819
It is April fool's day.

457
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:32,089
The price rising so insanely high

458
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:34,425
is kind of a little bit unprecedented,

459
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:37,628
so-- I mean, it's bound to pop a little bit.

460
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,730
Maybe. I don't know.

461
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:41,932
Maybe it'll be at 225 in a week and a half,

462
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:45,236
so who knows? Bitcoin styles--

463
00:21:45,238 --> 00:21:47,038
Could go up, could go down.

464
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:55,146
<i>As the price passed 100,</i>

465
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,648
<i>we took a trip to visit Gavin Andresen.</i>

466
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,919
<i>He is known to have worked
closely with Satoshi</i>

467
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,321
<i>during Bitcoin's early days.</i>

468
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,763
Here's the train tracks, and he did say

469
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:14,725
there would be train tracks
maybe passing through.

470
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:19,470
Here we go. This is Gavin's house.

471
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,078
<i>Gavin is one of the last people</i>

472
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,447
<i>to communicate with Satoshi
before he disappeared.</i>

473
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:36,087
Morning. This is my brother Nick

474
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:38,122
- and his wife Ashley.
- Nice to meet you.

475
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:39,623
- <i>Hi, nice to meet you.</i>
- Nice to meet you.

476
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,926
Found the place okay, so-- - good.

477
00:22:41,928 --> 00:22:44,128
We're very excited to be here.

478
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,263
Come in. This is my humble house.

479
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:49,333
<i> </i> - That's where I work.
This is where I live.

480
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:55,406
- Beautiful home.
- Well, thanks.

481
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:57,975
<i>A little higher, please.
Right there. </i> Great.

482
00:22:57,977 --> 00:23:00,077
<i> Got it.</i>

483
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,313
<i>How did you first get into Bitcoin?</i>

484
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:04,248
<i>Tell us a little bit of the story
of how you got involved.</i>

485
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,484
I had been working at UMass

486
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:07,818
as a staff programmer

487
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,153
in the computer science

488
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:10,654
department research group.

489
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:12,990
<i>My wife's a Professor at UMass.</i>

490
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:14,792
<i>I actually quit that job before going</i>

491
00:23:14,794 --> 00:23:17,228
<i>on a six-month sabbatical in Australia.</i>

492
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,997
I just happened to read a little blurb

493
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:22,133
<i>online in somebody's blog</i>

494
00:23:22,135 --> 00:23:24,268
that mentioned this Bitcoin project,

495
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:27,037
which is an open-source attempt to do money.

496
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,039
And it caught my interest.

497
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:32,943
<i>I basically just spent a few days</i>

498
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:34,945
<i>read everything I could about it</i>

499
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:37,348
<i>looked at the source code,
downloaded the source code,</i>

500
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,050
thought about it and I really
couldn't convince myself

501
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:41,919
that it would not work.

502
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,921
<i>It seemed like Satoshi had
thought of everything.</i>

503
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,657
Since then...

504
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:50,261
I've just been sucked down the rabbit hole.

505
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:53,030
<i>Bitcoin is open-source software.</i>

506
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:54,632
<i>With open-source software,</i>

507
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:56,400
<i>the code is publicly available.</i>

508
00:23:56,402 --> 00:23:59,103
<i>Anyone can look at it and see how it runs.</i>

509
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:01,639
<i>And they can also contribute
their own changes.</i>

510
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:05,276
<i>Programmers like Gavin were able to
join Satoshi to work on Bitcoin</i>

511
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,278
<i>simply because they were interested.</i>

512
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,748
Over time, I think Satoshi
learned to trust me.

513
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:14,118
<i>He could see that I didn't make
very many stupid mistakes.</i>

514
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,720
I never had any personal
connection with Satoshi.

515
00:24:16,722 --> 00:24:18,489
It was always purely business.

516
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:21,225
And I think that's because
he was so worried about

517
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:22,960
people finding out his identity.

518
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:26,564
I don't know why. My last email to him

519
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:28,265
was telling him that I had

520
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:30,734
agreed to go visit the folks at the C.I.A.,

521
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:32,736
so...

522
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:34,472
Whether that had something to do with him

523
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:37,174
deciding to cut off
communication with me entirely--

524
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:39,510
<i>He had been pulling away before then,</i>

525
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:42,580
but the C.I.A. Invited me
to come talk at the C.I.A.

526
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:44,348
And I agreed to do that.

527
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:47,651
<i>Knowing it would surely spark</i>

528
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:50,120
<i>conspiracy theories,
Gavin posted an announcement</i>

529
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:52,122
<i>on the Bitcoin talk discussion forum</i>

530
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:53,691
<i>to head off any rumors.</i>

531
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:03,467
<i>Having taken on the lead developer position</i>

532
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:05,636
<i>since Satoshi's disappearance,</i>

533
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:08,939
<i>Gavin found himself facing an increasing
number of responsibilities</i>

534
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:10,608
<i>and public scrutiny.</i>

535
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,043
Do your neighbors know that
you're kind of at the center

536
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:15,913
of one of the most disruptive technologies?

537
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:20,050
I think-- I think they know that
I do this wacky Bitcoin project.

538
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:24,588
I don't think they know
quite how big it is yet.

539
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,624
Right now,

540
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:29,393
Bitcoin's a billion-dollar project.

541
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:31,896
<i>When I started it was this
tiny little experiment.</i>

542
00:25:31,898 --> 00:25:33,931
And as it gets bigger,

543
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:37,134
the pressure to not screw up

544
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:39,503
just gets bigger and bigger.

545
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:45,075
<i>Two weeks later</i>

546
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:47,144
<i>the price soared past 150.</i>

547
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:48,913
<i>And some Bitcoiners woke up</i>

548
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:51,415
<i>to find out they were Bitcoin millionaires.</i>

549
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:53,284
<i>23-year-old Charlie Shrem</i>

550
00:25:53,286 --> 00:25:55,920
<i>is the C.E.O. of a company
called Bitlnstant.</i>

551
00:25:55,922 --> 00:26:00,090
<i>Bitlnstant was one of the first
startups in the Bitcoin space.</i>

552
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:02,259
<i>In Bitcoin's infancy, people had to jump</i>

553
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:04,261
<i>through several hoops to buy them.</i>

554
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:05,729
<i>One of the only ways</i>

555
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,431
<i>was through the Mt. Gox exchange,</i>

556
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:09,466
<i>but this process required transferring money</i>

557
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:10,801
<i>through several intermediaries</i>

558
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:12,770
<i>and could take weeks.</i>

559
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:15,973
<i>Charlie launched Bitlnstant to
streamline this process.</i>

560
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:18,709
<i>And to help people buy Bitcoins quickly.</i>

561
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:21,078
<i> Yeah, that's good. That's great.</i>

562
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,746
- <i> That's pretty nice.</i>
- You go like that.

563
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,481
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

564
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:26,150
<i>Today Charlie is being photographed</i>

565
00:26:26,152 --> 00:26:27,885
<i>for an article in "Businessweek."</i>

566
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:29,587
<i>One of the ideas they had</i>

567
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,488
<i>was that you're going--
Throwing stuff up in the air</i>

568
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,524
<i>and they were gonna add
Bitcoins in later on.</i>

569
00:26:33,526 --> 00:26:35,259
- Going like that?
- <i> Yeah.</i>

570
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:38,929
<i>This Bitcoin thing can actually
change the world.</i>

571
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,098
<i>But for this thing to succeed,</i>

572
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,700
we have to figure out a
way to get more money

573
00:26:42,702 --> 00:26:44,735
in and out of the ecosystem.

574
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:47,705
Look out the window a bit. Totally-- yeah.

575
00:26:47,707 --> 00:26:49,406
Then you can look-- Yeah, that's good.

576
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:51,508
And not show that I'm super
stressed out right now

577
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:54,244
and we have thousands of
orders that are being processed

578
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:56,947
and I'm bugging out,
trying to get the new site launched.

579
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:59,183
- <i> No, don't look like that.</i>
- It's crazy.

580
00:26:59,185 --> 00:27:00,918
I'm trying not to, but it's really hard.

581
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:07,992
<i>Things have been insane.</i>

582
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,764
<i>I haven't slept in days.</i>

583
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:15,866
<i>The price is just rising, so a lot of people</i>

584
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:17,001
<i>are putting money into it.</i>

585
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,970
<i>Normally, Charlie can get Bitcoins</i>

586
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:22,239
<i>to his customers in about an hour.</i>

587
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:23,774
<i>But with the recent flood of people</i>

588
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,442
<i>trying to purchase Bitcoins,</i>

589
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:28,946
<i>Bitlnstant can't fill their
orders fast enough.</i>

590
00:27:28,948 --> 00:27:31,749
When I pulled up our
customer service interface,

591
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:34,418
<i>we have close to 2,000 open tickets.</i>

592
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,321
And that's just from
Saturday to this morning.

593
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:38,622
Nobody was ready

594
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,757
for this kind of volume,

595
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:42,426
so we're trying to catch up

596
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:45,396
with the volume and keep everybody happy.

597
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:47,464
Man on phone: <i>Can you just
sort of describe quickly</i>

598
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:50,734
<i>what the last week or so has
been like for you guys?</i>

599
00:27:50,736 --> 00:27:53,604
The last week or so saw our support staff

600
00:27:53,606 --> 00:27:55,639
go from two people to five people.

601
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:56,740
When someone offers you

602
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:57,941
a seat on the rocket,

603
00:27:57,943 --> 00:27:59,309
you don't ask where the seat is.

604
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:00,978
You just get on the rocket.

605
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,481
Further, our volume has basically tripled

606
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:06,750
in the past two weeks,

607
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:09,219
<i>going from a few hundred transactions a day</i>

608
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:12,289
to now two, three thousand
transactions a day.

609
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:13,791
- <i> You just came onboard here, right?</i>
- Yeah, I did.

610
00:28:13,793 --> 00:28:15,959
Actually, today is kinda my first day.

611
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:17,561
- <i> Oh really?</i>
- Yeah.

612
00:28:17,563 --> 00:28:19,430
<i>How does it feel to be a part
of all this madness?</i>

613
00:28:19,432 --> 00:28:21,899
Um, well, madness, yeah.

614
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:23,967
<i>It's overwhelming.</i>

615
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,070
<i>And what do you do for Bitlnstant?</i>

616
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:28,038
I'm the C.F.O.

617
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,441
Man on phone: <i>Can you give
me a daily estimate</i>

618
00:28:30,443 --> 00:28:32,609
<i>of how much money you're moving
through your system?</i>

619
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:34,712
Um, it's in the--

620
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:37,047
In the six figures every day.

621
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,515
<i>All right. Well, thanks, Charlie.</i>

622
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:40,451
- <i> I really appreciate it.</i>
- Thank you.

623
00:28:40,453 --> 00:28:44,088
<i>I don't know how the government
will react to Bitcoin,</i>

624
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:47,291
<i>but I spend thousands of dollars
on lawyers every day</i>

625
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:49,253
<i>just to make sure that I'm
not gonna go to jail.</i>

626
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:53,697
It's super terrifying.
I mean, I don't wanna go to jail.

627
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:57,301
I don't wanna become a martyr either.

628
00:29:09,115 --> 00:29:11,248
<i>Bitcoin was the talk of the town.</i>

629
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,150
<i>Charlie was in the limelight</i>

630
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:15,953
<i>and could barely keep up
with media requests.</i>

631
00:29:15,955 --> 00:29:19,089
<i>Within hours, the price passed $200.</i>

632
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,563
<i>First day of spring,</i>

633
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:28,198
<i>first day Bitcoin is over 200.</i>

634
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,633
<i>The start of a new era.</i>

635
00:29:29,635 --> 00:29:30,968
<i>Hi. Nice to meet you.</i>

636
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,703
I'm the nice warm loving mom

637
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:35,072
that makes him live at home.

638
00:29:35,074 --> 00:29:39,209
'Cause we can't--
We can't part from him yet.

639
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,080
<i>We love him too much.</i>

640
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:44,915
This is where it all started

641
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:46,357
and this is where it still goes down.

642
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:50,420
I've been collecting money
from all over the world.

643
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:52,556
And it's just something I
did way before Bitcoin.

644
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:54,024
I've been doing it since I was a kid.

645
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:55,893
So it's funny that I'm
collecting all this...

646
00:29:55,895 --> 00:29:57,761
Fiat that's not worth anything

647
00:29:57,763 --> 00:29:59,930
and then all of a sudden I
get into this Bitcoin thing.

648
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,934
<i>I realized during high school that</i>

649
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:06,203
<i>I could never work for anyone.</i>

650
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:07,604
<i>I made up a term--</i>

651
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:09,573
Psychologically unemployable.

652
00:30:09,575 --> 00:30:11,842
<i>I started Bitlnstant while I was still</i>

653
00:30:11,844 --> 00:30:13,844
<i>in my senior year of college.</i>

654
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:18,182
<i>Bitcoin currently is the largest
social-economic experiment</i>

655
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:20,184
<i>ever conducted in the history of the world.</i>

656
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:23,287
<i>2013, possibly 2014,</i>

657
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:25,622
<i>will be the two years that really
make or break Bitcoin.</i>

658
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:30,894
<i>Bitcoin is the first product that's digital,</i>

659
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:32,262
<i>but it's also scarce.</i>

660
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:38,302
<i>I got some good news last night that</i>

661
00:30:38,304 --> 00:30:40,571
<i>part of our licensing deals that
we've been trying to do</i>

662
00:30:40,573 --> 00:30:42,039
<i>for the past few months are finally,</i>

663
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:43,540
<i>hopefully, coming through.</i>

664
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:45,809
We got approved to be licensed

665
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:48,345
in 30 of the 48 states
in money transmission.

666
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:52,449
I've been working very hard
on trying to be compliant

667
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:53,951
in the legal realm

668
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:56,787
and with FinCEN's announcement,

669
00:30:56,789 --> 00:30:59,923
setting up a way for Bitcoin
companies to legally exist,

670
00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:02,292
that really changes the
whole game of Bitcoin.

671
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:06,230
And for us, it helped us get that last push

672
00:31:06,232 --> 00:31:07,898
that we needed from all the banks

673
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,867
and the regulators to finally, hopefully,

674
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,335
get that licensing that we need.

675
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:17,040
<i>Today, Charlie's meeting with a realtor</i>

676
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,742
<i>to talk about new office space.</i>

677
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:20,911
Hi, Charlie, nice to meet you.

678
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:22,746
- Hi, I'm Mitch Waldman. How are you?
- A pleasure.

679
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:25,249
- Got a minute?
- I have 10 minutes for you.

680
00:31:25,251 --> 00:31:27,918
We're-- we're a company
with no boss, essentially.

681
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,553
Everyone has their responsibilities.

682
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:31,388
It's just one big executive board.

683
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,923
- It's just one big executive board.
- Okay.

684
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:35,859
If I don't do my job,
these guys are all gonna yell at me.

685
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:38,362
<i> So that's how we do it, but we get things
done.</i> - Waldman:<i> All right.</i>

686
00:31:38,364 --> 00:31:40,297
We're outgrowing this space,
as you can see here.

687
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:42,933
- That's a good problem to have.
- Yes.

688
00:31:42,935 --> 00:31:44,935
Now Rachel said there was a great concern

689
00:31:44,937 --> 00:31:47,070
- about security in this space.
- <i> Yeah.</i>

690
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,673
<i>We're regulated, so we can't share an office</i>

691
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:51,675
- with another company if they have access to us.
- I get that.

692
00:31:51,677 --> 00:31:54,077
<i>Our asset is our software.</i>

693
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,847
Our software is processing hundreds
of thousands of dollars a day

694
00:31:56,849 --> 00:31:58,448
instantly. Really quickly.

695
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,684
And that's on-site here?
Or is it in the cloud?

696
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:02,552
No, this is in the cloud.
It's all in the cloud, but we monitor--

697
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:04,288
We have to monitor everything from here...

698
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,790
Right. -...And debug, fix,
take down, upload more--

699
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:09,760
- Put up more workers.
- We deal with high-volume data-oriented stuff every day.

700
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:11,295
Very very sensitive customer data.

701
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:13,764
<i>If there were not a doorman,</i>

702
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:16,099
at the very least the space would
be designed in such a manner

703
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:19,036
that there'd be a locked reception area.

704
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:21,204
If we want to pursue a guard at some point,

705
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:23,874
we could have them in that area.

706
00:32:23,876 --> 00:32:25,709
I absolutely think

707
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:28,311
- It will be at some point. It's just a matter of time.
- <i> Really?</i>

708
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,948
<i>The potential for theft is huge.</i>

709
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,383
It's like operating a bank, essentially.

710
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:34,785
<i>That's pretty much it.</i>

711
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:36,420
- Gotcha.
- It's basic stuff.

712
00:32:36,422 --> 00:32:38,522
Yup yup. All right.

713
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:40,123
Any other words for me?

714
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,995
- Okay.
- Are you willing to handle the task?

715
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:49,967
Sign me up, captain.

716
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:57,007
<i>That night, the price got as high as $266.</i>

717
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:59,776
<i>Every major news outlet had taken notice.</i>

718
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:01,845
<i>Bitcoin fever was at an all-time high.</i>

719
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:03,613
It is getting a lot of attention.

720
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:05,682
People are fascinated by
anything that makes new highs

721
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:08,085
every day for weeks on end,
which Bitcoin has done.

722
00:33:08,087 --> 00:33:09,353
In terms of the total number of the people

723
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:11,088
using the currency, I'm not sure,

724
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,589
but you can say that there's a huge amount

725
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:15,492
of fluctuation in the volume of trading.

726
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,928
<i>And then the price crashed.</i>

727
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,902
<i>Bitcoin lost more than half of its value</i>

728
00:33:25,904 --> 00:33:27,537
<i>in six hours.</i>

729
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:30,207
From craze to crash.

730
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:33,243
It's the talk of many
people in the blogosphere,

731
00:33:33,245 --> 00:33:36,246
and it's certainly suffering
some growing pains.

732
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:40,017
The value of the virtual
currency Bitcoin has plunged.

733
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:41,118
It's been a crazy day today.

734
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,253
I haven't slept in like 40 hours.

735
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,125
<i>Your order processed. I don't understand</i>

736
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:49,526
<i>why we're still having this conversation.</i>

737
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:52,062
<i>We refunded your order.
We sent you extra Bitcoins.</i>

738
00:33:52,064 --> 00:33:53,397
<i>I don't care, man.</i>

739
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:55,565
<i>When it comes to my money,
I don't fuck around.</i>

740
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:56,900
<i>I know, man. You need your stuff.</i>

741
00:33:56,902 --> 00:33:58,635
<i>I hear ya, I hear ya. It processed.</i>

742
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:00,203
<i>Your Bitcoins are there, man.</i>

743
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,041
<i>So, Charlie, what's been going on today?</i>

744
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:06,410
- <i> Crazy day, huh?</i>
- Yeah, Mt. Gox--

745
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:09,212
Their whole system pretty much failed

746
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:11,448
and their whole trading engine is broken.

747
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:15,619
Pretty much caused-- almost--
Us to shut down for the day.

748
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:17,754
<i>Further, the Bitcoin price has just been</i>

749
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:19,056
<i>wildly swinging up and down</i>

750
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:21,358
it was down $100 today.

751
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,394
It's gaining back up, but mostly
because people can't buy and sell

752
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:26,196
and they can't withdraw
and they can't deposit.

753
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:28,899
'Cause the whole thing is just--
it's just a Fritz.

754
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:31,201
So what we're trying to
do is figure out a way

755
00:34:31,203 --> 00:34:33,770
<i>to mitigate orders somewhere else for now.</i>

756
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:36,106
<i>With Mt. Gox stuck in a nosedive,</i>

757
00:34:36,108 --> 00:34:39,376
<i>the ripple effect is creating chaos
in the Bitcoin Markets.</i>

758
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,848
<i>I'm trying to figure out</i>

759
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:47,117
<i>why our orders aren't going through.</i>

760
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,718
Rachel, am I allowed to take another Advil

761
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,554
if I took one an hour ago?

762
00:34:50,556 --> 00:34:53,623
They've been having problems
ordering anything off of Gox.

763
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:55,859
Yeah, I'm getting a lot
of customers emailing,

764
00:34:55,861 --> 00:34:58,028
saying "it says 'executed,
' but it's not showing in the blockchain."

765
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,563
<i>Dude, Gox suspended trading.</i>

766
00:34:59,565 --> 00:35:00,831
- Really?
- Yeah.

767
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:02,732
"Orders placed suspended until 2100."

768
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:04,167
What time-- What's 2100?

769
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:06,503
What? That's 9:00 P.M. oh my God.

770
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:21,985
If you bought at 150...

771
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,288
And then you're at 260,

772
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:28,225
and then you watch it dip down back to 150,

773
00:35:28,227 --> 00:35:30,227
do you panic some? Yeah, absolutely.

774
00:35:30,229 --> 00:35:32,095
I don't know what a Bitcoin is.
I just bought it.

775
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:35,732
Fuck.

776
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:37,234
You see buy orders, people buying

777
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:40,537
and selling at such a wide range.

778
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:42,372
It doesn't make any sense.

779
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:44,574
<i>The a.P.I. Is just constantly failing?</i>

780
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:47,056
<i>Is that what's going on?
Or are we're not getting any orders.</i>

781
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:58,021
<i>Don't care about the price.</i>

782
00:35:58,023 --> 00:35:59,856
Speculators can play musical chairs

783
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:01,558
all day long for all I care.

784
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,660
I'm-I'm-- I'm long.

785
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:08,932
<i>I was focused on expanding
my mining operation.</i>

786
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:13,069
<i>The only people that are gonna be shaken out</i>

787
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:14,905
<i>by this drop</i>

788
00:36:14,907 --> 00:36:17,340
<i>are people that are new to Bitcoin.</i>

789
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:20,177
Here's the Avalons, spinning away,

790
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:21,711
mining away.

791
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:23,847
And if everything goes as planned,

792
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,749
we'll have 18 more of these guys

793
00:36:25,751 --> 00:36:28,084
<i>in a couple of weeks.</i>

794
00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:30,053
<i>Bitcoin is a complicated thing.</i>

795
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:31,588
You have to spend some time looking into it

796
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,557
and understanding it before you really care.

797
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:36,092
Now there's droves of people that--

798
00:36:36,094 --> 00:36:38,028
You know, are giving it
more than just that glance,

799
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,230
because the price has gone so high.

800
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:43,066
And they have dollar signs in
their eyes like Uncle scrooge.

801
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:45,335
<i>It's so much more than that,</i>

802
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:47,337
<i>and I think that's why the
people who are mining</i>

803
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:49,072
<i>and the people who believe in it</i>

804
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:50,674
<i>are just kind of holding strong.</i>

805
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,213
<i>When trading resumed at Mt. Gox,</i>

806
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:59,416
<i>the price fell even further, to around $70.</i>

807
00:36:59,418 --> 00:37:01,851
71 on B.T.C.-E.

808
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:07,357
Yeah, Bitcoin-- It's volatile.

809
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,794
It's gonna be a long time
until we have stability.

810
00:37:10,796 --> 00:37:12,062
That's the nature of the beast.

811
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:16,199
Price discovery can be violent and volatile.

812
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:19,436
There's gonna be a lot of
people that come and go,

813
00:37:19,438 --> 00:37:21,638
and people that scream wolf.

814
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,406
<i>But at the end of the day,</i>

815
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:26,243
<i>the only thing that really
kind of stinks right now</i>

816
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:28,878
<i>is that everybody is trading on one platform</i>

817
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,780
that isn't doing the greatest job, so...

818
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:34,784
Over time, hopefully we'll see
some more exchanges pop up

819
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:36,419
and get some more options in.

820
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,288
People wanna keep using Bitcoin,

821
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,590
I'm sure the infrastructure will come.

822
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:02,946
It's just gotten ridiculously busy.

823
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,416
I get an email every two seconds now

824
00:38:06,418 --> 00:38:09,552
and pretty much more email than I-- -<i> </i>

<i>I actually accept rent in Bitcoin,</i>

whether that's now,

850
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:28,498
10 years from now, a hundred years from now.

851
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,667
We're going to be using digital currencies

852
00:39:30,669 --> 00:39:32,635

00:39:38,844 --> 00:39:40,443
<i>and was forced to shut down.</i>

856
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:44,047
<i>Recently he met Ryan singer</i>

857
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:46,583
<i>and together they are
relaunching the exchange.</i>

858
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:47,717
The business we're in is

859
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,185
helping people speculate, right?

860
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:50,754
Markets are

861
00:39:50,756 --> 00:39:52,422
price discovery mechanisms.

862
00:39:52,424 --> 00:39:53,690
That's what they're for.

863
00:39:53,692 --> 00:39:55,825
People-- They buy, they sell,

864
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:57,394
there's the bid, there's the ask

865
00:39:57,396 --> 00:40:00,363
and the price moves. And when it levels out,

866
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:02,265
then that's what the Market price is.

867
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:04,534
I can't even count the amount
of people that have said,

868
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:06,069
"Bitcoin's not backed by anything.

869
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:07,937
At least dollars are backed by gold."

870
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:10,240
<i>I've realized that a lot of
people believe that.</i>

871
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:13,610
<i>My grandfather, he got me into investing</i>

872
00:40:13,612 --> 00:40:14,944
<i>when I was a kid. I was five years old.</i>

873
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:16,780
<i>I could explain a p/e ratio,</i>

874
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:19,115
<i>and what a bid and an ask was,</i>

875
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:20,884
and the difference between a
limit order and a Market order

876
00:40:20,886 --> 00:40:22,285
and all that stuff, so for me,

877
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:24,220
I saw this as a way that the average person

878
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:25,955
could actually take
control of their finances.

879
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:28,358
<i>I just grew up pretty nerdy.</i>

880
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,428
I don't know. Then like at 15 years old,

881
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,129
I decided I didn't want
to be a nerd anymore,

882
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:36,366
which was a mistake... 'Cause...

883
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,702
'Cause now I realize it's pretty awesome.

884
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,073
<i>In 1999 I joined the marines.</i>

885
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:46,443
<i>I was originally with an engineering unit.</i>

886
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:49,712
<i>2005, I went over to Afghanistan.</i>

887
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:52,182
<i>I was mostly working with the
Afghan national army.</i>

888
00:40:52,184 --> 00:40:54,317
<i>It changed me a lot as a person.</i>

889
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:58,755
I've always been interested in economics

890
00:40:58,757 --> 00:41:00,924
and finance and technology and cryptography.

891
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,927
<i>I was in a cryptography forum</i>

892
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:06,095
<i>and somebody I'd never met--
Who was anonymously</i>

893
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:07,597
<i>in this forum that I was chatting with--</i>

894
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,065
<i>Sent me 10,000 Bitcoins</i>

895
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:11,267
<i>just as a way to test the system out</i>

896
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:12,836
and see how it worked, and I got 'em.

897
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:14,571
I'm like, "that's cool,
but what can I do with them?"

898
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:17,040
And he said, "well, nothing yet, but...

899
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:19,442
If people believe it has value, it will."

900
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:22,412
<i>At the time, there was really
only one Bitcoin exchange</i>

901
00:41:22,414 --> 00:41:25,014
<i>it was Mt. Gox. I said,
"we need an alternative.</i>

902
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:27,016
Who cares if the technology is decentralized

903
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:28,551
and the method of transfer is decentralized

904
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:30,186
and the people are decentralized

905
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:32,155
if all the trades are in the same location?"

906
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:34,657
<i>I thought that building another exchange</i>

907
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,092
<i>to give more people access to Bitcoin</i>

908
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:39,028
<i>would be a key part of Bitcoin's growth.</i>

909
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:42,098
The day we launched, we got a quarter-million
dollars in from user deposits.

910
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,368
And we said, "oh shit,
this is-- this is real.

911
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,569
Yeah.

912
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:49,072
Hey.

913
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:53,009
We're all fans of "The Big Lebowski,"

914
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:55,445
so we're gonna have a "Big Lebowski" party.

915
00:41:55,447 --> 00:41:56,980
Nice!

916
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:02,085
It's a... Very exciting day.

917
00:42:02,087 --> 00:42:05,855
<i>30 gallons of white Russian
and hallway bowling.</i>

918
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:09,225
Yeah!

919
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:11,594
<i>We work hard, but we party hard too.</i>

920
00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:14,163
Okay. Okay, I'm good.

921
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:16,266
- <i> All right.</i>
- I'm good. I'm not dead.

922
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,673
Yeah, I'm the first one in the house...

923
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,844
That opened a Tradehill account.

924
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:53,403
<i>What happened?</i>

925
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:57,574
In the same day they went down to 90--

926
00:42:57,576 --> 00:43:00,710
$65 or something, or $90 a Bitcoin.

927
00:43:00,712 --> 00:43:03,947
I stopped smiling.

928
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:15,024
<i>Tradehill, round two,
we optimized for success.</i>

929
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:16,993
<i>We launched expecting to have to do</i>

930
00:43:16,995 --> 00:43:18,835
hundreds of thousands of
transactions a second.

931
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:22,599
<i>Right now we've got about 15 people</i>

932
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:25,535
<i>in addition to that, we've got about
eight attorneys externally.</i>

933
00:43:25,537 --> 00:43:27,737
A lot of people are depositing dollars.

934
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:29,706
A lot of people are depositing Bitcoin.
We're getting more trading.

935
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:31,608
We're pushing that from
a business perspective.

936
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,276
<i>Also, we're talking to people</i>

937
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:35,678
<i>who want to do more automated
trading on our platform.</i>

938
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,747
Get robots trading against each other.

939
00:43:37,749 --> 00:43:39,082
We've stress tested this

940
00:43:39,084 --> 00:43:43,419
and we can handle about
500 times as much volume

941
00:43:43,421 --> 00:43:45,054
<i>as Mt. Gox was seeing.</i>

942
00:43:45,056 --> 00:43:46,956
So we'll see what happens here.

943
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:49,892
The interest in us is pretty crazy.

944
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:52,729
<i>Just the news with Bitcoin</i>

945
00:43:52,731 --> 00:43:55,398
<i>has really kind of validated everything.</i>

946
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,600
Now people are like, "oh,
you're not this crazy person

947
00:43:57,602 --> 00:43:59,736
talking about some digital
made-up currency."

948
00:43:59,738 --> 00:44:02,605
It's like, "oh, I've read about
it in 'the wall street journal'

949
00:44:02,607 --> 00:44:04,273
and 'the New York times.' It's real."

950
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:06,409
<i>We had an investor come in</i>

951
00:44:06,411 --> 00:44:08,311
<i>and he said, "hey, I really appreciate</i>

952
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:10,647
<i>your scrappy nature and how you're hustling,</i>

953
00:44:10,649 --> 00:44:13,383
but I think it's time for you guys
to spend 30 grand a month on rent.

954
00:44:13,385 --> 00:44:15,985
When you have a billionaire client

955
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:17,387
and they want to come check out your office

956
00:44:17,389 --> 00:44:19,589
before they send you a
multi-million dollar wire,

957
00:44:19,591 --> 00:44:21,691
asking them to walk past pawn shops

958
00:44:21,693 --> 00:44:23,660
is not always the right feel.

959
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:30,667
So we're leaving the mission.
We're driving into Soma right now.

960
00:44:30,669 --> 00:44:34,504
We're gonna go take a look at
what may be our new office space

961
00:44:34,506 --> 00:44:36,906
pretty prestigious address-- One Market.

962
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,248
<i>Right now we're trying to forge this path,</i>

963
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,417
<i>and we're trying to comply
with existing laws</i>

964
00:44:47,419 --> 00:44:49,018
<i>and anticipate future laws,</i>

965
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,255
<i>which is extremely expensive
and extremely difficult.</i>

966
00:44:52,257 --> 00:44:53,690
- Is there parking here?
- <i> Yes.</i>

967
00:44:53,692 --> 00:44:55,224
Okay, is that included with--

968
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:57,160
Of course.

969
00:44:57,162 --> 00:44:59,562
Right, what does that-- how much does-- -

970
00:44:59,564 --> 00:45:00,596
How much does that cost?

971
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:04,534
That's not terrible.

972
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:07,437
Whoa.

973
00:45:07,439 --> 00:45:09,338
That's pretty sexy.

974
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:13,676
Twitter was here for over a year.

975
00:45:13,678 --> 00:45:16,145
- Yeah.
- Amazon comes and go every single year.

976
00:45:16,147 --> 00:45:18,381
- Oh, fantastic.
- I have Macy's, I have J.C. Penney.

977
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:20,349
All the big ones, they come over.

978
00:45:20,351 --> 00:45:21,391
They are part of the club.

979
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,224
Sounds good. We'll be here tomorrow.

980
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:29,325
- Picking it up.
- Thank you for the business.

981
00:45:29,327 --> 00:45:30,259
- Thank you.
- I appreciate it.

982
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:32,161
Thanks so much.

983
00:45:32,163 --> 00:45:33,830
- We move in tomorrow.
- <i> Just like--</i>

984
00:45:33,832 --> 00:45:35,398
- <i> just like that, huh?</i>
- Just like that.

985
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,933
- That's how we roll.
- <i> It's pretty surprising</i>

986
00:45:36,935 --> 00:45:38,234
<i>that that deal just happened so quickly.</i>

987
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:39,836
<i>What was it? You just liked the space</i>

988
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:40,970
<i>and decided, "hey,
there's no point in waiting"?</i>

989
00:45:40,972 --> 00:45:43,039
We like the space, we like the address.

990
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:44,741
We just don't have the time to spend either.

991
00:45:44,743 --> 00:45:46,342
We've got all kinds of important
stuff we're working on

992
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:49,011
and if we spend a week
trying to find an office,

993
00:45:49,013 --> 00:45:50,780
and he and I put 20 hours into it

994
00:45:50,782 --> 00:45:53,049
or 50 hours into it,
it's a huge waste of time.

995
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:14,670
I thought they'd be in multiple bags

996
00:46:14,672 --> 00:46:16,739
rather than one big one, but hey...

997
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:26,015
<i>I believe that Bitcoin will do

00:46:32,891 --> 00:46:34,757

and don't keep them here.

1026
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:30,546
I normally do them on this mirror

1027
00:47:30,548 --> 00:47:34,183
'cause that helps me get
the fronts and backs right.

1028
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:37,553
<i>There's so many things that
cryptography can do for us,</i>

1029
00:47:37,555 --> 00:47:39,722
that if the world just knew,

1030
00:47:39,724 --> 00:47:42,592
<i>so many social problems could be solved.</i>

1031
00:47:42,594 --> 00:47:46,963
Cryptography can bring
fairness to elections.

1032
00:47:46,965 --> 00:47:49,966
<i>It's too difficult for people to understand</i>

1033
00:47:49,968 --> 00:47:53,069
<i>and someone needs to bridge the gap.</i>

1034
00:47:53,071 --> 00:47:56,339
<i>Right now we're using Bitcoin to send money.</i>

1035
00:47:56,341 --> 00:47:59,175
<i>But many believe it will
revolutionize much more.</i>

1036
00:47:59,177 --> 00:48:02,011
<i>The technology behind Bitcoin</i>

1037
00:48:02,013 --> 00:48:04,513
<i>can be used to build decentralized systems</i>

1038
00:48:04,515 --> 00:48:06,582
<i>with rules that can't be cheated.</i>

1039
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:15,324
Now see, this is my wife and my space.

1040
00:48:15,326 --> 00:48:16,993
- This is, you know--
- Awesome.

1041
00:48:16,995 --> 00:48:18,661
It is what it is.

1042
00:48:18,663 --> 00:48:19,896
<i>The more time goes by,</i>

1043
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:21,397
<i>the more legitimate Bitcoin gets</i>

1044
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:23,666
<i>and the more proud I am to
be associated with it.</i>

1045
00:48:23,668 --> 00:48:25,468
Now what does your wife do?

1046
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:27,136
She does crafts.

1047
00:48:27,138 --> 00:48:28,671
She's a lot like me.

1048
00:48:28,673 --> 00:48:30,306
We just sit around and make things all day.

1049
00:48:30,308 --> 00:48:32,575
<i>It's just our obsession.</i>

1050
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:35,044
No, I'm not a drug dealer.
No, I'm not a criminal.

1051
00:48:35,046 --> 00:48:36,812
No, I'm not a terrorist.

1052
00:48:36,814 --> 00:48:38,180
<i>I believe in the rule of law.</i>

1053
00:48:38,182 --> 00:48:40,082
I believe in structure that builds society.

1054
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:41,384
I believe in families.

1055
00:48:41,386 --> 00:48:42,919
<i>I believe in corporations.</i>

1056
00:48:42,921 --> 00:48:45,655
<i>I believe in all the essential elements</i>

1057
00:48:45,657 --> 00:48:48,691
that a civilized society with law and order

1058
00:48:48,693 --> 00:48:50,426
need to be able to function.

1059
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:52,528
Focal length matters.

1060
00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:57,500
Cryptography is the basis

1061
00:48:57,502 --> 00:49:00,136
for us being able to implement
the values we say we believe in.

1062
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:05,675
<i>This idea will never die,</i>

1063
00:49:05,677 --> 00:49:09,712
<i>the technology that Bitcoin
brought to the forefront.</i>

1064
00:49:09,714 --> 00:49:11,013
The genie is out of the bottle.

1065
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:24,660
<i>Since the crash, the Bitcoin price</i>

1066
00:49:24,662 --> 00:49:26,762
<i>has been hovering around $100.</i>

1067
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:30,466
<i>Bitcoins seem to have weathered the storm,</i>

1068
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:33,803
<i>but there's still much controversy
surrounding the currency.</i>

1069
00:49:33,805 --> 00:49:36,906
<i>The same cryptography that
insures a user's privacy</i>

1070
00:49:36,908 --> 00:49:39,642
<i>also allows it to be used anonymously.</i>

1071
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:51,153
<i>My father decided to retire</i>

1072
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:53,255
<i>and he had an old failing print shop.</i>

1073
00:49:53,257 --> 00:49:54,924
<i>I basically took it over</i>

1074
00:49:54,926 --> 00:49:56,646
<i>and I converted it into an Internet place.</i>

1075
00:49:58,061 --> 00:49:59,161
We're the only place in L.A.

1076
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:00,496
That supports Bitcoin right now.

1077
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:09,772
This is my Linux system here.

1078
00:50:09,774 --> 00:50:13,342
It's a system that also mines for Bitcoins.

1079
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,611
<i>Makes about a dollar a day.
I just do it for fun.</i>

1080
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,848
I was really really into the Internet,

1081
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:22,251
literally in 1990, 1991, 1992,

1082
00:50:22,253 --> 00:50:24,353
and I had the hardest time describing

1083
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:26,522
what the Internet was to people.

1084
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:28,824
<i>I would tell people, "well,
it's like this network of computers.</i>

1085
00:50:28,826 --> 00:50:31,060
And the network of computers

1086
00:50:31,062 --> 00:50:32,995
can talk with other networks of computers

1087
00:50:32,997 --> 00:50:34,997
and then you could exchange information."

1088
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:37,333
And people would have no idea what it was.

1089
00:50:37,335 --> 00:50:40,669
- -<i> When people
ask me what Bitcoin is</i>

1090
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:42,905
<i>I have the hardest time
describing what it is.</i>

1091
00:50:42,907 --> 00:50:46,042
<i>And I'd surmise it as,
"it's basically money.</i>

1092
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:47,643
<i>It's basically an anonymous PayPal.</i>

1093
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,347
<i>It's one of those things
that you have to use</i>

1094
00:50:51,349 --> 00:50:52,882
<i>before you understand.</i>

1095
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,252
<i>Politically, I'm not a very big fan</i>

1096
00:50:56,254 --> 00:50:58,788
<i>of either the banks or federal reserve,</i>

1097
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:00,990
and Bitcoin allows me to get around that.

1098
00:51:00,992 --> 00:51:04,193
One of the programs we support
is a protocol called "Tor."

1099
00:51:04,195 --> 00:51:07,229
And basically what Tor does is
it allows you to communicate

1100
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:09,165
to a website anonymously.

1101
00:51:09,167 --> 00:51:11,487
<i>Tor is a program that allows you
to get on the silk road.</i>

1102
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,070
And this is silk road.

1103
00:51:14,072 --> 00:51:17,406
<i>Basically, any drug you want is available.</i>

1104
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:19,675
There's a lot of weed.
There's a lot of cocaine.

1105
00:51:19,677 --> 00:51:20,976
<i>There's a lot of ecstasy.</i>

1106
00:51:20,978 --> 00:51:22,978
<i>But there's also unusual drugs,</i>

1107
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,580
like if you want some
sort of anabolic steroid,

1108
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:26,816
you can type "steroid."

1109
00:51:26,818 --> 00:51:28,250
You'll get all the different types

1110
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:30,019
<i>of steroids that are available.</i>

1111
00:51:30,021 --> 00:51:32,321
Silk road itself is not selling the drugs.

1112
00:51:32,323 --> 00:51:34,090
<i>This is basically a matchmaker</i>

1113
00:51:34,092 --> 00:51:35,658
<i>between buyer and seller.</i>

1114
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:37,393
Both the buyer and seller
don't know each other.

1115
00:51:37,395 --> 00:51:39,528
Both the buyer and seller are anonymous.

1116
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:41,897
<i>It goes on this web of trust.</i>

1117
00:51:41,899 --> 00:51:44,633
If you want to, let's say,
buy this testosterone,

1118
00:51:44,635 --> 00:51:46,235
<i>you'd click on this.</i>

1119
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:49,905
He has 99.3 positive feedback

1120
00:51:49,907 --> 00:51:52,408
from more than 300 transactions.

1121
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:55,511
So even though the contracts
aren't enforceable by law,

1122
00:51:55,513 --> 00:51:57,680
the reputation system makes it so that

1123
00:51:57,682 --> 00:52:00,249
the system works pretty well.

1124
00:52:00,251 --> 00:52:02,451
Oh, there's a fireworks section now.
I didn't know that.

1125
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:07,156
<i>Florida I.D., 1.88 Bitcoins,</i>

1126
00:52:07,158 --> 00:52:10,559
which is around $150, something like that.

1127
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:12,962
<i>A forged auto insurance card,</i>

1128
00:52:12,964 --> 00:52:15,664
<i>forged passport.</i>

1129
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:17,733
There is over 9,000 entries for drugs.

1130
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:20,669
That's a lot.

1131
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:24,273
I would say there's around
maybe five customers

1132
00:52:24,275 --> 00:52:25,875
that know about it and use it.

1133
00:52:25,877 --> 00:52:27,877
It's a very small percentage
of the people that come in.

1134
00:52:27,879 --> 00:52:29,512
But the people who do know about it,

1135
00:52:29,514 --> 00:52:31,147
specifically come here to use it.

1136
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,152
<i>What the customers do with the computers</i>

1137
00:52:36,154 --> 00:52:38,554
<i>is pretty much their business.</i>

1138
00:52:38,556 --> 00:52:40,856
Another day in the office.

1139
00:52:40,858 --> 00:52:43,826
You gonna do drug dealing of any sort,

1140
00:52:43,828 --> 00:52:45,127
silk road is the place to go.

1141
00:52:45,129 --> 00:52:48,297
How many people are selling
cannabis right now?

1142
00:52:48,299 --> 00:52:51,534
<i>It looks like 2,011 people
are selling cannabis.</i>

1143
00:52:51,536 --> 00:52:53,135
They call me Mr. Bitcoin.

1144
00:52:53,137 --> 00:52:55,004
<i>I probably been dealing drugs</i>

1145
00:52:55,006 --> 00:52:57,540
since I was like 17.

1146
00:52:57,542 --> 00:52:59,909
<i>Right now I'm 26.</i>

1147
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:03,179
<i>I think of it as a global thing</i>

1148
00:53:03,181 --> 00:53:04,380
<i>when I'm on the computer.</i>

1149
00:53:04,382 --> 00:53:06,916
<i>I'm doing business with the world.</i>

1150
00:53:06,918 --> 00:53:08,517
Let's see, they have blue dream,

1151
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:11,353
sour diesel, pineapple Thai,

1152
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:14,390
purple kush, girl scout cookies.
Purple pays.

1153
00:53:14,392 --> 00:53:16,225
When I first heard about it,

1154
00:53:16,227 --> 00:53:17,893
I was laughing about it. It took me a week

1155
00:53:17,895 --> 00:53:19,895
to just even think about this for real.

1156
00:53:19,897 --> 00:53:21,830
"I can really make money off the Internet?

1157
00:53:21,832 --> 00:53:24,392
Selling this type of stuff on the Internet?
You sure about that?"

1158
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,170
This something I probably
may buy right here.

1159
00:53:28,172 --> 00:53:31,307
<i>They have looks like some good kush.</i>

1160
00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:33,809
<i>And some of these things only
take a day to get here</i>

1161
00:53:33,811 --> 00:53:35,811
<i>with no harassment from nobody</i>

1162
00:53:35,813 --> 00:53:37,513
instead of just being on the streets.

1163
00:53:37,515 --> 00:53:39,415
<i>Once you get the hang of it,
it's actually kinda fun</i>

1164
00:53:39,417 --> 00:53:40,977
<i>just looking through different things.</i>

1165
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,853
"Mr. Bitcoin." I'm running with it.

1166
00:53:44,855 --> 00:53:46,355
I like the name. You know what I mean?

1167
00:53:46,357 --> 00:53:48,190
I'm not gonna lie. I get Booty off this.

1168
00:53:48,192 --> 00:53:50,025
I kinda like talking about
this stuff with girls.

1169
00:53:50,027 --> 00:53:52,161
Girls like that shit hot.

1170
00:53:52,163 --> 00:53:55,364
"Oh, you're street,
and you got a little nerd knowledge?

1171
00:53:55,366 --> 00:53:56,966
This is great."

1172
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:00,402
<i>I have a lot of Bitcoins saved up already.</i>

1173
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:02,404
<i>My business is doing good.</i>

1174
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:05,307
It's a fun way of doing hustling these days.

1175
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:07,343
The future brung a different way to hustle

1176
00:54:07,345 --> 00:54:08,811
and I like it.

1177
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:24,026
<i>With so many people using Bitcoin</i>

1178
00:54:24,028 --> 00:54:25,828
<i>in so many different ways,</i>

1179
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:28,230
<i>it's becoming apparent that
it can't be ignored.</i>

1180
00:54:32,902 --> 00:54:34,403
- Let me see your driver's license.
- Oh sure.

1181
00:54:34,405 --> 00:54:37,139
This stays at the desk until
you leave the building.

1182
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:39,174
<i>Today I'm visiting FinCEN,</i>

1183
00:54:39,176 --> 00:54:41,377
<i>a bureau of the U.S.
department of the treasury.</i>

1184
00:54:41,379 --> 00:54:45,080
<i>Despite having released guidance
on virtual currencies,</i>

1185
00:54:45,082 --> 00:54:47,549
<i>there's still a lot of uncertainty
surrounding their outlook</i>

1186
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,718
<i>on the future of Bitcoin regulation.</i>

1187
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,321
Straight ahead and in the
big fishbowl-looking--

1188
00:54:52,323 --> 00:54:54,356
<i>Okay, great.</i>

1189
00:54:56,994 --> 00:54:58,494
I'm not gonna say we're gonna have

1190
00:54:58,496 --> 00:54:59,828
every answer for you today,

1191
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:02,064
but I mean...

1192
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,422
<i> Oh yeah.</i>

1193
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:32,194
<i>Jennifer Shasky Calvery came onboard</i>

1194
00:55:32,196 --> 00:55:34,463
<i>as FinCEN's director last year.</i>

1195
00:55:34,465 --> 00:55:36,865
<i>During her career, she spent 15 years</i>

1196
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:38,667
<i>at the department of justice</i>

1197
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,469
<i>where she specialized in
fighting money laundering</i>

1198
00:55:40,471 --> 00:55:42,204
<i>and organized crime.</i>

1199
00:55:42,206 --> 00:55:43,672
Virtual currencies have been on my radar

1200
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:45,641
for a while, even prior to coming

1201
00:55:45,643 --> 00:55:48,877
to this position, because of,

1202
00:55:48,879 --> 00:55:51,313
unfortunately, the abuse of some of them.

1203
00:55:51,315 --> 00:55:53,048
Bitcoin, on the other hand,

1204
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:55,984
is one that really didn't come on my radar

1205
00:55:55,986 --> 00:55:57,886
probably until I arrived at FinCEN.

1206
00:55:57,888 --> 00:55:59,888
<i>Depending on who you speak to,</i>

1207
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:01,390
<i>the issuance of our guidance was</i>

1208
00:56:01,392 --> 00:56:03,892
either the best thing that
ever happened to Bitcoin

1209
00:56:03,894 --> 00:56:06,061
or the worst thing that
ever happened to Bitcoin.

1210
00:56:06,063 --> 00:56:08,697
<i>Some accusing us of trying to kill Bitcoin</i>

1211
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:11,667
<i>and others saying that it
somehow legitimized it.</i>

1212
00:56:11,669 --> 00:56:15,337
Of course, neither of those
things I think is probably true.

1213
00:56:15,339 --> 00:56:17,706
And certainly neither of
those things was our intent.

1214
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:21,210
<i>One of the clear lines is that
if you're a consumer</i>

1215
00:56:21,212 --> 00:56:24,146
<i>who's using Bitcoins to buy
goods and services,</i>

1216
00:56:24,148 --> 00:56:26,081
<i>the guidance doesn't pertain to you.</i>

1217
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:29,017
We're focused more on the
places where we think

1218
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:32,054
we have risks to the U.S. financial system

1219
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:33,889
from money laundering
and terrorist financing.

1220
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:35,991
And I think that might be kind of--

1221
00:56:35,993 --> 00:56:39,428
A lot of the Bitcoin community
has a little bit of a fear

1222
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:42,464
that Bitcoin may be characterized

1223
00:56:42,466 --> 00:56:46,368
in a way so as to tie it to some
bad actor ruining it for everyone,

1224
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:48,404
<i>when a lot of people that are
interested in Bitcoin,</i>

1225
00:56:48,406 --> 00:56:52,107
including myself, see it as just
this technology that we don't--

1226
00:56:52,109 --> 00:56:54,143
Really don't wanna see it falling

1227
00:56:54,145 --> 00:56:56,044
into the wrong categorization

1228
00:56:56,046 --> 00:56:58,280
with all the potential that's there.

1229
00:56:58,282 --> 00:57:02,484
Sure. So that innovation around Bitcoin

1230
00:57:02,486 --> 00:57:05,154
and the virtual economy

1231
00:57:05,156 --> 00:57:08,524
is really one of the
more interesting aspects,

1232
00:57:08,526 --> 00:57:10,859
I think, of this story-- The idea that

1233
00:57:10,861 --> 00:57:14,163
<i>it can be used to potentially serve</i>

1234
00:57:14,165 --> 00:57:15,964
<i>the unbanked out there,</i>

1235
00:57:15,966 --> 00:57:18,567
<i>just to provide some really new services</i>

1236
00:57:18,569 --> 00:57:20,602
<i>that are convenient for consumers.</i>

1237
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:22,004
The flip side of it though

1238
00:57:22,006 --> 00:57:24,506
is that to be a part of
the financial system--

1239
00:57:24,508 --> 00:57:27,810
The U.S. financial system,
the global financial system--

1240
00:57:27,812 --> 00:57:29,711
Also comes with some responsibilities.

1241
00:57:29,713 --> 00:57:32,347
And those responsibilities include

1242
00:57:32,349 --> 00:57:35,617
<i>not allowing your institution to be used</i>

1243
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:39,621
by criminals and by terrorists.

1244
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,195
<i>There's always been a concern</i>

1245
00:57:46,197 --> 00:57:48,464
<i>that the government might try
to stamp out Bitcoin.</i>

1246
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,435
<i>But perhaps they see the risk
of being left behind.</i>

1247
00:57:58,174 --> 00:58:01,276
<i>In may 2013, the biggest gathering to-date</i>

1248
00:58:01,278 --> 00:58:03,512
<i>of Bitcoin enthusiasts and entrepreneurs</i>

1249
00:58:03,514 --> 00:58:05,781
<i>happened in San Jose, California.</i>

1250
00:58:05,783 --> 00:58:07,850
<i>We're at Bitcoin 2013.</i>

1251
00:58:07,852 --> 00:58:10,786
It's the inaugural conference
of the Bitcoin foundation.

1252
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,825
Roger Ver: <i>Bitcoin is worldwide and
the vast majority of people</i>

1253
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:19,194
haven't even heard of Bitcoin yet.

1254
00:58:19,196 --> 00:58:21,830
It's more powerful than every computer

1255
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:23,565
on the top-500 list combined.

1256
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,002
It's an awfully big world,

1257
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:29,104
an awful lot of things could happen.

1258
00:58:29,106 --> 00:58:32,040
<i>Really, we've been on a roller-coaster ride</i>

1259
00:58:32,042 --> 00:58:35,177
<i>and I expect, at least for
the next few years,</i>

1260
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:37,746
<i>we're gonna remain on a roller-coaster ride.</i>

1261
00:58:37,748 --> 00:58:40,249
I happen to enjoy roller coasters.

1262
00:58:40,251 --> 00:58:42,084
I think they're fun.

1263
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:44,620
<i>Just a few weeks earlier</i>

1264
00:58:44,622 --> 00:58:46,255
<i>Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss,</i>

1265
00:58:46,257 --> 00:58:48,257
<i>known for their involvement in Facebook,</i>

1266
00:58:48,259 --> 00:58:50,192
<i>announce that they own a 1% stake</i>

1267
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:51,994
<i>of all Bitcoins in existence.</i>

1268
00:58:51,996 --> 00:58:54,096
<i>Worth around $11 million.</i>

1269
00:58:54,098 --> 00:58:56,698
- How's it going? How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

1270
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,668
<i>They also made a $1.5 million investment</i>

1271
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:01,837
<i>in Charlie's company, Bitlnstant.</i>

1272
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:04,339
We started looking seriously at it

1273
00:59:04,341 --> 00:59:05,874
at the end of last summer

1274
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:08,510
and started purchasing around that time.

1275
00:59:08,512 --> 00:59:11,179
I think a light bulb just
went off and we said, "wow.

1276
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:13,515
The implication of this could be enormous.

1277
00:59:13,517 --> 00:59:15,651
<i>If everyone in the world could
have a Bitcoin address,</i>

1278
00:59:15,653 --> 00:59:18,620
everyone in the world could
be banked fairly quickly.

1279
00:59:18,622 --> 00:59:20,522
<i>And when you consider that,</i>

1280
00:59:20,524 --> 00:59:22,357
it's a very powerful idea.

1281
00:59:22,359 --> 00:59:25,160
And Bitcoin can make that happen.

1282
00:59:25,162 --> 00:59:26,395
We're going all over the world.

1283
00:59:26,397 --> 00:59:27,529
We're going to the U.K.

1284
00:59:27,531 --> 00:59:28,797
We're going to Australia.

1285
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,799
We're going to-- We're already in Russia.

1286
00:59:30,801 --> 00:59:32,868
<i>We're going to South America.</i>

1287
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:34,403
We're already in Brazil now.

1288
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:36,538
You can buy Bitcoin at any of our locations.

1289
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:39,341
<i>It's fun to think that Satoshi
might be here too.</i>

1290
00:59:39,343 --> 00:59:40,976
I always wonder if somebody is--

1291
00:59:40,978 --> 00:59:43,345
If someone here somewhere is...

1292
00:59:43,347 --> 00:59:45,667
Yes. I was planning-- -...
Standing in the corner going--

1293
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:55,157
What would he do?

1294
00:59:55,159 --> 00:59:58,493
What talks would he be attending, you know?

1295
00:59:58,495 --> 01:00:01,163
Trace Mayer: <i>We're seeing the
Bitcoin players in the Market</i>

1296
01:00:01,165 --> 01:00:02,998
<i>meeting with the venture capitalists</i>

1297
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,700
<i>and they're all beginning to posture</i>

1298
01:00:04,702 --> 01:00:05,801
and that's very exciting,

1299
01:00:05,803 --> 01:00:07,169
because it means that

1300
01:00:07,171 --> 01:00:08,470
there's gonna be a lot more

1301
01:00:08,472 --> 01:00:09,972
infrastructure built out,

1302
01:00:09,974 --> 01:00:11,673
and lot more money flowing into the space,

1303
01:00:11,675 --> 01:00:15,344
and it's really gonna be a
big bull Market for Bitcoin.

1304
01:00:15,346 --> 01:00:17,679
<i>One of the companies best known for making</i>

1305
01:00:17,681 --> 01:00:21,350
<i>Bitcoin accessible for commerce
is Atlanta-based BitPay.</i>

1306
01:00:21,352 --> 01:00:23,652
<i>They are pioneers in Bitcoin</i>

1307
01:00:23,654 --> 01:00:25,487
<i>and provide a service that enables merchants</i>

1308
01:00:25,489 --> 01:00:26,855
<i>to accept Bitcoin payments</i>

1309
01:00:26,857 --> 01:00:29,191
<i>without dealing with its complexities.</i>

1310
01:00:29,193 --> 01:00:30,993
We've grown about a factor of 10

1311
01:00:30,995 --> 01:00:33,161
since the beginning of the year.

1312
01:00:33,163 --> 01:00:34,830
We were doing about half a
million dollars a month...

1313
01:00:34,832 --> 01:00:36,198
- Yeah. - ...Around
the turn of the year,

1314
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,000
and now we're doing about
$5 million a month.

1315
01:00:38,002 --> 01:00:41,269
<i>This is people using Bitcoins to
buy real goods and services.</i>

1316
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:42,871
<i>They're not day trading.
They're not exchanging.</i>

1317
01:00:42,873 --> 01:00:44,272
They're actually buying things.

1318
01:00:44,274 --> 01:00:47,309
I'm confident that Bitcoin is
the most important invention

1319
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:49,044
in the entire history of the
world since the Internet.

1320
01:00:49,046 --> 01:00:50,879
<i>Roger Ver is an investor</i>

1321
01:00:50,881 --> 01:00:52,514
<i>in several early Bitcoin companies,</i>

1322
01:00:52,516 --> 01:00:54,216
<i>including BitPay.</i>

1323
01:00:54,218 --> 01:00:55,984
<i>His passion and enthusiasm</i>

1324
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:58,687
<i>has earned him the nickname "Bitcoin Jesus."</i>

1325
01:00:58,689 --> 01:01:00,155
<i>It is going to change everything.</i>

1326
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:01,490
And all of you here in this room

1327
01:01:01,492 --> 01:01:03,492
you're at the very very forefront of that.

1328
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:09,131
<i>Roger lives in Tokyo</i>

1329
01:01:09,133 --> 01:01:12,367
<i>but travels the earth, spreading
the good word of Bitcoin.</i>

1330
01:01:12,369 --> 01:01:14,369
<i>The last couple of days
we've been setting up</i>

1331
01:01:14,371 --> 01:01:16,705
<i>a business per day to accept Bitcoin
here in the bay area.</i>

1332
01:01:16,707 --> 01:01:18,006
<i>Today's business is going to be</i>

1333
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:20,008
<i>this Super Kyo-Po Korean supermarket.</i>

1334
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:23,011
So for you-- you accept
credit cards right now?

1335
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,347
- Right.
- The credit card companies are charging you 2% or 3%?

1336
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:27,382
- Right.
- For Bitcoin, you can do the same thing,

1337
01:01:27,384 --> 01:01:28,950
but they'll only charge you 1%

1338
01:01:28,952 --> 01:01:30,886
and you'll still get dollars
in your bank account.

1339
01:01:30,888 --> 01:01:32,387
If you want, you can choose to split

1340
01:01:32,389 --> 01:01:34,156
some of the payments that you receive

1341
01:01:34,158 --> 01:01:36,191
into Bitcoins and then some into dollars

1342
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:38,760
in whatever ratio you want,
so you can keep 99% in dollars

1343
01:01:38,762 --> 01:01:41,930
and 1% in Bitcoin or 99% in
Bitcoin and 1% in dollars.

1344
01:01:41,932 --> 01:01:43,852
- <i> Okay.</i>
- However you want. You can decide that.

1345
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:46,768
<i>Roger is describing the service</i>

1346
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:48,403
<i>provided by BitPay.</i>

1347
01:01:48,405 --> 01:01:50,839
<i>They take the volatility of Bitcoin's price</i>

1348
01:01:50,841 --> 01:01:52,607
<i>out of the equation for merchants</i>

1349
01:01:52,609 --> 01:01:54,676
<i>by immediately converting
Bitcoins to dollars</i>

1350
01:01:54,678 --> 01:01:56,078
<i>at the time of sale.</i>

1351
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,113
So right now we have it set to 100% dollars,

1352
01:01:58,115 --> 01:02:00,248
so anybody that pays here with Bitcoin,

1353
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,850
they'll deposit the money
into your bank account

1354
01:02:01,852 --> 01:02:04,152
the very next day with only a 1% fee.

1355
01:02:04,154 --> 01:02:05,687
And I guarantee you over
the next couple of weeks

1356
01:02:05,689 --> 01:02:07,022
you'll have lots of computer nerds

1357
01:02:07,024 --> 01:02:08,990
that love Bitcoins will be coming in here

1358
01:02:08,992 --> 01:02:10,992
specifically to shop at your supermarket,

1359
01:02:10,994 --> 01:02:12,314
so that they can pay with Bitcoin.

1360
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:17,199
The credit card companies,
just for processing the payment,

1361
01:02:17,201 --> 01:02:19,534
they take anywhere from...

1362
01:02:19,536 --> 01:02:22,637
1.5% to over 3%

1363
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:24,840
and then on certain cards

1364
01:02:24,842 --> 01:02:26,641
there's even a per-transaction fee,

1365
01:02:26,643 --> 01:02:28,844
like 20¢ per transaction

1366
01:02:28,846 --> 01:02:31,012
plus the percentage of the transaction.

1367
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:36,017
...$11,000, $12,000 a month

1368
01:02:36,019 --> 01:02:39,454
on the average that they just
take right out of our account.

1369
01:02:39,456 --> 01:02:40,622
I honestly think that

1370
01:02:40,624 --> 01:02:41,723
there's a really good chance

1371
01:02:41,725 --> 01:02:43,458
that Bitcoins will be more than $1,000

1372
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:45,627
by the end of the year,
because everybody who hears about--

1373
01:02:45,629 --> 01:02:47,729
"wait, I can send money to
and from anyone I want?"

1374
01:02:47,731 --> 01:02:50,465
It's impossible for anyone
to freeze your account,

1375
01:02:50,467 --> 01:02:53,568
it's impossible for anyone to block you
from sending or receiving these Bitcoins.

1376
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:55,403
<i>...Euros, so you can see</i>

1377
01:02:55,405 --> 01:02:57,739
all these different currency
exchanges around the world

1378
01:02:57,741 --> 01:02:59,674
that exchange to and from Bitcoins.

1379
01:02:59,676 --> 01:03:03,178
You can see there's maybe between
50 and 100 exchanges now.

1380
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:05,814
When I first heard about Bitcoin and
started telling everybody about it,

1381
01:03:05,816 --> 01:03:07,983
if you looked at that same page,
there were less than 10.

1382
01:03:07,985 --> 01:03:11,052
And there's no central office that
they could raid or anything like that?

1383
01:03:11,054 --> 01:03:12,554
There's no central-- It's amazing.

1384
01:03:12,556 --> 01:03:13,855
There's no central office,

1385
01:03:13,857 --> 01:03:15,290
<i>there's no central place they could go to</i>

1386
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:17,125
and say, "take Steve's Bitcoins,"

1387
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:19,127
or, "give Steve's Bitcoins to Kevin."
Do this or do that.

1388
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:20,862
So who's the owner of Bitcoins?

1389
01:03:20,864 --> 01:03:23,498
- Everybody that owns Bitcoins?
- Yeah yeah.

1390
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:26,134
Just like who's the owner of gold?
It's whoever owns some gold.

1391
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:28,203
Short of shutting down the entire Internet

1392
01:03:28,205 --> 01:03:30,338
in the entire world,
there's no way to stop Bitcoin.

1393
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:38,213
And hit "request payment."

1394
01:03:38,215 --> 01:03:40,816
And that's the Q.R.
Code for your Bitcoin address.

1395
01:03:40,818 --> 01:03:42,184
So I'm gonna scan that...

1396
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:46,321
So now I have your Bitcoin
address on my phone.

1397
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:48,290
I think this is $2,

1398
01:03:48,292 --> 01:03:50,425
so I'm going to send you $2

1399
01:03:50,427 --> 01:03:51,993
worth of Bitcoins.

1400
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,000
There it is. You just
received that many Bitcoins

1401
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:00,302
from me, directly with no fee

1402
01:04:00,304 --> 01:04:02,204
and if you hit the little green square

1403
01:04:02,206 --> 01:04:04,139
it'll show you the equivalent
amount in U.S. dollars.

1404
01:04:04,141 --> 01:04:06,975
<i>So you just received $2 worth of Bitcoins</i>

1405
01:04:06,977 --> 01:04:08,276
<i>directly from my phone to your phone.</i>

1406
01:04:08,278 --> 01:04:10,312
And you can send money just
like that anywhere in the world.

1407
01:04:10,314 --> 01:04:12,480
You could've told me your Bitcoin address

1408
01:04:12,482 --> 01:04:14,349
by email or posted on Facebook

1409
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:16,117
or Twitter or anywhere.

1410
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:18,720
So I could print this and
have it at the register.

1411
01:04:18,722 --> 01:04:21,156
Yeah. Yup, and you can
check right on your phone

1412
01:04:21,158 --> 01:04:22,791
any time that you received the payment.

1413
01:04:22,793 --> 01:04:24,693
<i> Okay. Thank you, Steve.</i>

1414
01:04:24,695 --> 01:04:25,994
- <i> All right. Thanks.</i>
- Thank you for the tea.

1415
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:35,303
<i>One of the newest standouts
in the Bitcoin space</i>

1416
01:04:35,305 --> 01:04:38,139
<i>is a San Francisco company named Coinbase.</i>

1417
01:04:38,141 --> 01:04:40,508
<i>They operate a digital wallet service</i>

1418
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:44,179
<i>that makes it simple to buy,
use and accept Bitcoin.</i>

1419
01:04:44,181 --> 01:04:45,947
<i>I would not be surprised at all</i>

1420
01:04:45,949 --> 01:04:47,949
if Google, square, PayPal-- Everybody--

1421
01:04:47,951 --> 01:04:49,451
Is looking at adding Bitcoin
in one or two years.

1422
01:04:49,453 --> 01:04:51,953
<i>By then we need to have 50 million wallets.</i>

1423
01:04:51,955 --> 01:04:53,288
<i>If we can make this easy to use,</i>

1424
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:55,357
<i>it's gonna be huge.</i>

1425
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:58,493
Fred Ehrsam: <i>My involvement in Bitcoin
is not politically motivated.</i>

1426
01:04:58,495 --> 01:05:02,764
- Yeah, dude.
- <i> People are realizing large capital gains.</i>

1427
01:05:02,766 --> 01:05:05,467
When professional investors enter the realm,

1428
01:05:05,469 --> 01:05:07,068
the stakes definitely change.

1429
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:09,804
<i>We raised $5 million from
union square ventures.</i>

1430
01:05:09,806 --> 01:05:11,740
<i>Fred Wilson led the round there.</i>

1431
01:05:11,742 --> 01:05:13,341
I think Bitcoin is still

1432
01:05:13,343 --> 01:05:15,977
actually a little bit under the radar.

1433
01:05:15,979 --> 01:05:20,015
<i>I think it's moved past the stage
where people dismiss it,</i>

1434
01:05:20,017 --> 01:05:21,816
<i>but I don't think that it's totally</i>

1435
01:05:21,818 --> 01:05:23,485
<i>gone mainstream either.</i>

1436
01:05:23,487 --> 01:05:26,087
I think we're in that
middle stage right now.

1437
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:28,089
<i>At the end of the conference,</i>

1438
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:30,125
<i>Jered from Tradehill threw a party</i>

1439
01:05:30,127 --> 01:05:32,294
<i>to celebrate how far things had come.</i>

1440
01:05:32,296 --> 01:05:34,296
You guys are hot right now.

1441
01:05:34,298 --> 01:05:35,931
- Yup.
- Congratulations on the raise.

1442
01:05:35,933 --> 01:05:37,499
- Thank you.
- It's good money, man.

1443
01:05:37,501 --> 01:05:39,501
- Swell do.
- Yeah.

1444
01:05:39,503 --> 01:05:43,438
I mean-- - hopefully it's an
advancement for the community.

1445
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,341
I am completely pro-compliance.

1446
01:05:46,343 --> 01:05:48,977
I think if you don't want to
attach your identity to this,

1447
01:05:48,979 --> 01:05:52,147
- just can't work with you.
- Yeah, so I thought I just need to--

1448
01:05:52,149 --> 01:05:54,950
I mean the libertarian side of me is like,
"ehh. Yeah, whatever,"

1449
01:05:54,952 --> 01:05:57,152
but like, from a business perspective,

1450
01:05:57,154 --> 01:05:59,554
if people don't play by the rules,

1451
01:05:59,556 --> 01:06:03,058
- you're not gonna last.
- Yeah, I completely agree.

1452
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:05,620
- You're gonna just shut down or you're gonna go to jail.
- Yeah.

1453
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:08,196
<i>Noticeably absent from the conference</i>

1454
01:06:08,198 --> 01:06:09,798
<i>were representatives of Bitcoin's</i>

1455
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,500
<i>biggest exchange, Mt. Gox.</i>

1456
01:06:12,502 --> 01:06:15,971
<i>Just days earlier the department
of homeland security</i>

1457
01:06:15,973 --> 01:06:18,873
<i>seized more than $5 million
from their U.S. accounts.</i>

1458
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:22,877
<i>The seizure warrant stated that Mt.
Gox had failed</i>

1459
01:06:22,879 --> 01:06:24,779
<i>to register as a money transmitter,</i>

1460
01:06:24,781 --> 01:06:27,615
<i>putting them in violation of the
new FinCEN guidelines.</i>

1461
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:37,292
<i>I'm traveling to Tokyo to
meet Mark Karpeles,</i>

1462
01:06:37,294 --> 01:06:39,227
<i>Mt. Gox's reclusive C.E.O.</i>

1463
01:06:42,465 --> 01:06:44,165
No Bitcoins on here.

1464
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:47,836
Not yet.

1465
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:50,138
<i>That will make this completely unnecessary.</i>

1466
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:51,840
<i>But for now it seems kind of primitive</i>

1467
01:06:51,842 --> 01:06:53,608
that we're exchanging paper for paper.

1468
01:06:54,978 --> 01:06:58,013
- <i> And losing.</i>
- And losing value.

1469
01:06:58,015 --> 01:07:00,915
Someone's taking a cut.
Someone's taking a little percent.

1470
01:07:00,917 --> 01:07:04,252
<i>Mark and his business partner Gonzague</i>

1471
01:07:04,254 --> 01:07:08,356
<i>are French but they operate Mt.
Gox from offices in Japan.</i>

1472
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:12,327
<i>Originally Mt. Gox was an
exchange for trading cards</i>

1473

<i>ic: The Gathering online exchange."</i>

1476
01:07:20,604 --> 01:07:23,805
<i>In 2011 Mark's company Tibanne</i>

1477
01:07:23,807 --> 01:07:27,442
<i>bought Mt. Gox, and his focus has
been Bitcoin ever since.</i>

1478
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:32,981
<i>One of the conditions of my visit</i>

1479
01:07:32,983 --> 01:07:34,349
<i>is to refrain from any discussion</i>

1480
01:07:34,351 --> 01:07:35,784
<i>about the D.H.S. Seizure,</i>

1481
01:07:35,786 --> 01:07:37,519
<i>due to the ongoing investigation.</i>

1482
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:42,357
<i>We've arrived at Mt. Gox.</i>

1483
01:07:42,359 --> 01:07:44,092
This is Mt. Gox right here.

1484
01:07:44,094 --> 01:07:47,362
There's no big sign or anything, no-- no--

1485
01:07:47,364 --> 01:07:51,699
It doesn't look like a crazy
commercial establishment.

1486
01:07:51,701 --> 01:07:54,169
<i>Despite their legal problems</i>

1487
01:07:54,171 --> 01:07:57,272
<i>Mt. Gox still handles more volume
than any other exchange</i>

1488
01:07:57,274 --> 01:07:59,107
<i>and is processing around</i>

1489
01:07:59,109 --> 01:08:02,277
<i>$6 million worth of Bitcoin
trades every day.</i>

1490
01:08:02,279 --> 01:08:04,846
We had, last year, an average
of 10,000 new customers a month.

1491
01:08:04,848 --> 01:08:06,748
January, it was 20,000.

1492
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:08,683
Then 30,000, 60,000,

1493
01:08:08,685 --> 01:08:10,351
150,000.

1494
01:08:10,353 --> 01:08:13,054
With what's going on, we go down,

1495
01:08:13,056 --> 01:08:15,890
but we are reaching 100,000 new customers

1496
01:08:15,892 --> 01:08:17,992
- for may.
- That's amazing.

1497
01:08:17,994 --> 01:08:19,561
- In a month?
- In a month.

1498
01:08:19,563 --> 01:08:20,829
- Wow.
- So it was like this...

1499
01:08:20,831 --> 01:08:21,996
Zip, bup!

1500
01:08:21,998 --> 01:08:23,832
But still, after what happened

1501
01:08:23,834 --> 01:08:25,800
I thought that a lot of people will go away

1502
01:08:25,802 --> 01:08:28,736
or don't create a new account.

1503
01:08:28,738 --> 01:08:30,405
But still, 100,000 new customers

1504
01:08:30,407 --> 01:08:31,806
it's... wow.

1505
01:08:31,808 --> 01:08:33,541
And here we've got the office.

1506
01:08:42,585 --> 01:08:45,253
<i>Mt. Gox employs 18 people</i>

1507
01:08:45,255 --> 01:08:47,622
<i>not only is Mark the C.E.O.,</i>

1508
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:50,492
<i>he's also the C.F.O., the lead developer</i>

1509
01:08:50,494 --> 01:08:54,162
<i>and performs all technical operations
to keep the exchange running.</i>

1510
01:08:55,332 --> 01:08:56,965
- C++.
- <i> C++.</i>

1511
01:08:56,967 --> 01:08:58,633
<i>Is that your main-- Is that your main</i>

1512
01:08:58,635 --> 01:08:59,868
- <i> programming language?</i>
- No.

1513
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:02,203
I've got a lot of main
programming languages.

1514
01:09:02,205 --> 01:09:03,972
<i>Yeah? What's your favorite
programming language?</i>

1515
01:09:03,974 --> 01:09:05,540
Really depend on what I need to do.

1516
01:09:05,542 --> 01:09:06,941
I create a good something really quick

1517
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:08,810
and I don't care about performance,

1518
01:09:08,812 --> 01:09:10,011
I use P.H.P.

1519
01:09:10,013 --> 01:09:11,846
If I care a little bit about performance,

1520
01:09:11,848 --> 01:09:14,149
I will use c++ with Q.T. Available.

1521
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:17,085
And if I care a lot about performance,
I will use Axum.

1522
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:23,892
When we go in, cameras down first,

1523
01:09:23,894 --> 01:09:26,060
- until we get to your servers and then back up.
- Exactly.

1524
01:09:26,062 --> 01:09:27,562
Okay.

1525
01:09:34,103 --> 01:09:37,939
Getting ready to go into the Mt.
Gox data center location.

1526
01:09:37,941 --> 01:09:39,407
Okay, cameras down.

1527
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:45,513
<i>We were allowed to snap a few photographs</i>

1528
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:24,485
<i>If Mt. Gox's new trading engine</i>

1529
01:10:24,487 --> 01:10:27,689
<i>can really support 100 million
orders per second,</i>

1530
01:10:27,691 --> 01:10:30,758
<i>it should be able to scale with the
demands of professional traders.</i>

1531
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:34,162
<i>But with complex legal problems
and increasing competition,</i>

1532
01:10:34,164 --> 01:10:36,364
<i>Mark's attention is pulled
in many directions.</i>

1533
01:10:47,176 --> 01:10:49,277
Do you work seven days a week, typically?

1534
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:51,946
- Yup.
- It seems that you do

1535
01:10:51,948 --> 01:10:53,848
the majority of all the heavy lifting.

1536
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:56,751
- Literally.
- Yeah.

1537
01:10:56,753 --> 01:11:00,288
You need to remove your
shoes in the entrance.

1538
01:11:03,292 --> 01:11:05,126
<i>Mark is a talented man</i>

1539
01:11:05,128 --> 01:11:07,428
<i>in one of the world's biggest cities...</i>

1540
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:10,498
<i>But maybe he should stick to
computer keyboards.</i>

1541
01:11:22,478 --> 01:11:24,212
Okay, I messed it up.

1542
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:32,253
- Awesome.
- <i> Yay.</i>

1543
01:11:32,255 --> 01:11:33,655
Yeah.

1544
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:51,806
Erik Voorhees. <i>We are here in
northern New Hampshire</i>

1545
01:11:51,808 --> 01:11:53,508
for the porcupine freedom festival.

1546
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:55,510
And this is an event put on each year

1547
01:11:55,512 --> 01:11:56,878
<i>by the free state project.</i>

1548
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:01,816
<i>Basically it's just a bunch of
crazy anarcho-capitalists,</i>

1549
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:03,751
<i>libertarian types in the woods,</i>

1550
01:12:03,753 --> 01:12:06,120
<i>with freedom and families.</i>

1551
01:12:06,122 --> 01:12:08,890
<i>Pretty much all of the vendors
accept Bitcoin.</i>

1552
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:14,262
Ahh!

1553
01:12:14,264 --> 01:12:16,264
It tastes much better
when bought with Bitcoin.

1554
01:12:16,266 --> 01:12:17,565
Thanks, guys.

1555
01:12:18,934 --> 01:12:21,602
Soups, salads and smoothies.

1556
01:12:21,604 --> 01:12:23,604
I would say one-third of our sales

1557
01:12:23,606 --> 01:12:25,306
have been in Bitcoin.

1558
01:12:25,308 --> 01:12:27,375
It's 20 bucks. So you're
gonna pay in Bitcoin?

1559
01:12:27,377 --> 01:12:30,111
- Uh, yeah.
- All right.

1560
01:12:30,113 --> 01:12:32,213
<i>Last year was our first year accepting it</i>

1561
01:12:32,215 --> 01:12:35,783
we did maybe 18 transactions,
20 transactions at the most.

1562
01:12:35,785 --> 01:12:37,785
And now we're up to close to 120.

1563
01:12:49,331 --> 01:12:52,333
<i>This community is really one
of the largest groups</i>

1564
01:12:52,335 --> 01:12:54,135
<i>of people in the U.S., I think,</i>

1565
01:12:54,137 --> 01:12:56,971
<i>that is truly adopting Bitcoin and
using it as a currency,</i>

1566
01:12:56,973 --> 01:12:59,240
<i>because of what it stands for and
because of what it enables.</i>

1567
01:13:00,744 --> 01:13:03,144
The world is seriously changing now

1568
01:13:03,146 --> 01:13:05,747
and it is changing in a very interesting,

1569
01:13:05,749 --> 01:13:07,949
<i>very radical, decentralized,</i>

1570
01:13:07,951 --> 01:13:09,471
and, in my opinion, positive direction.

1571
01:13:10,853 --> 01:13:12,787
Shoot. Here it is.

1572
01:13:12,789 --> 01:13:14,155
"Price breaks the all-time high."

1573
01:13:15,858 --> 01:13:17,792
<i>Vitalik is only 19 years old,</i>

1574
01:13:17,794 --> 01:13:19,660
<i>but he has a profound understanding</i>

1575
01:13:19,662 --> 01:13:21,262
<i>of the complexities of Bitcoin</i>

1576
01:13:21,264 --> 01:13:23,231
<i>and a gift for explaining them.</i>

1577
01:13:23,233 --> 01:13:26,167
<i>As lead writer for "Bitcoin magazine,"</i>

1578
01:13:26,169 --> 01:13:29,837
<i>he's been traveling the world,
covering Bitcoin for the past year.</i>

1579
01:13:29,839 --> 01:13:33,608
I'm a big fan of the decentralization
concept, in principle.

1580
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:37,512
You know, have lots--
Lots of different societies

1581
01:13:37,514 --> 01:13:41,949
operating according to whatever
people's own beliefs are.

1582
01:13:41,951 --> 01:13:44,085
Bitcoin has unique properties

1583
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:46,921
that no other system in
the world has had before.

1584
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:50,691
It really seems like the
only practical way forward.

1585
01:13:50,693 --> 01:13:53,094
As you move away from cash

1586
01:13:53,096 --> 01:13:55,663
into your debit cards and your credit cards,

1587
01:13:55,665 --> 01:13:56,631
you essentially are giving up

1588
01:13:56,633 --> 01:13:58,433
a certain degree of your privacy

1589
01:13:58,435 --> 01:14:00,067
without even really knowing it.

1590
01:14:00,069 --> 01:14:01,769
<i>It's important to understand
that Bitcoin is not</i>

1591
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:04,071
automatically, perfectly anonymous.

1592
01:14:04,073 --> 01:14:07,675
But what it does is it enables you
to be anonymous if you wish to.

1593
01:14:07,677 --> 01:14:10,578
<i>Erik Voorhees is the founder and part owner</i>

1594
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:12,513
<i>of a hugely popular Bitcoin gambling site</i>

1595
01:14:12,515 --> 01:14:13,981
<i>called Satoshi Dice.</i>

1596
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:17,485
<i>Satoshi Dice is the first of a new breed</i>

1597
01:14:17,487 --> 01:14:18,853
<i>of provably fair betting games</i>

1598
01:14:18,855 --> 01:14:20,421
<i>that use Bitcoin.</i>

1599
01:14:20,423 --> 01:14:22,490
<i>Since all bets are public,</i>

1600
01:14:22,492 --> 01:14:25,726
<i>anyone can verify the odds and payouts.</i>

1601
01:14:25,728 --> 01:14:28,463
<i>At its peak, Satoshi Dice was responsible</i>

1602
01:14:28,465 --> 01:14:30,064
<i>for more Bitcoin transactions</i>

1603
01:14:30,066 --> 01:14:33,501
<i>than all other uses of Bitcoin combined.</i>

1604
01:14:33,503 --> 01:14:36,537
<i>It played an important role in
Bitcoin's development</i>

1605
01:14:36,539 --> 01:14:38,372
<i>as one of the first applications</i>

1606
01:14:38,374 --> 01:14:41,309
<i>to really test what the Bitcoin
network could handle.</i>

1607
01:14:41,311 --> 01:14:45,313
<i>Recently Erik moved his entire
operations out of the U.S.</i>

1608
01:14:45,315 --> 01:14:46,948
<i>And into Panama.</i>

1609
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:49,116
<i>He started a company called Coinapult</i>

1610
01:14:49,118 --> 01:14:52,386
<i>that lets you send Bitcoin
via s.M.S. And email.</i>

1611
01:14:52,388 --> 01:14:54,388
I think most people,

1612
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:55,990
at least in America,

1613
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:59,327
believe that when they put
$1,000 into their bank,

1614
01:14:59,329 --> 01:15:02,563
the bank is holding $1,000
in its vault for them.

1615
01:15:02,565 --> 01:15:06,000
And they don't realize that 99%
of all the dollars are digital.

1616
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:08,736
The fact that we have these
tokens called paper cash

1617
01:15:08,738 --> 01:15:11,672
is the exception to the rule.

1618
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:14,775
<i>People see the cash and they think
that that's what the money is,</i>

1619
01:15:14,777 --> 01:15:16,944
but it's all digital and it's
been that way for decades.

1620
01:15:16,946 --> 01:15:18,913
You guys moved your business to Panama.

1621
01:15:18,915 --> 01:15:20,982
<i>What was the primary driver in that?</i>

1622
01:15:20,984 --> 01:15:22,517
<i>If you're a U.S. company,</i>

1623
01:15:22,519 --> 01:15:25,686
you have to follow the
arcane U.S. regulations

1624
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:27,421
for all of your customers around the world.

1625
01:15:27,423 --> 01:15:29,490
So if you do business with
some rural farmer in Africa,

1626
01:15:29,492 --> 01:15:31,626
you're gonna need to get
his social security number,

1627
01:15:31,628 --> 01:15:33,027
you're gonna need to get
all this information

1628
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:34,762
that Washington tells you is important.

1629
01:15:34,764 --> 01:15:36,030
<i>We did not want to have to apply</i>

1630
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:38,666
<i>the U.S. financial regulatory scheme</i>

1631
01:15:38,668 --> 01:15:41,369
<i>to customers in sub-Saharan Africa.</i>

1632
01:15:41,371 --> 01:15:42,803
<i>I don't think the developed world's</i>

1633
01:15:42,805 --> 01:15:45,106
gonna be where Bitcoin
really takes off, long-term,

1634
01:15:45,108 --> 01:15:47,208
because our banking system's
worked decently well.

1635
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:48,809
<i>Many people around the world</i>

1636
01:15:48,811 --> 01:15:50,611
<i>don't have any bank accounts whatsoever.</i>

1637
01:15:50,613 --> 01:15:51,979
Ultimately, those are the types of people

1638
01:15:51,981 --> 01:15:53,814
who will find the most value out of Bitcoin.

1639
01:15:59,187 --> 01:16:01,088
<i>One month later Erik announced</i>

1640
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:03,958
<i>he had sold Satoshi dice to
an anonymous investor.</i>

1641
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,593
<i>The price?</i>

1642
01:16:05,595 --> 01:16:09,564
<i>126,315 Bitcoins,</i>

1643
01:16:09,566 --> 01:16:13,334
<i>worth around $11.5 million.</i>

1644
01:16:13,336 --> 01:16:16,771
Most of the new offices in this
city are in this condition,

1645
01:16:16,773 --> 01:16:18,472
all still what's called "gray."

1646
01:16:18,474 --> 01:16:20,942
Not ready, no Internet,
no electricity-- nothing.

1647
01:16:20,944 --> 01:16:22,910
But we actually got one that was finished,

1648
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:25,880
<i>so we moved in and we are
super excited about it.</i>

1649
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:29,050
You can see all the skyscrapers

1650
01:16:29,052 --> 01:16:31,619
of new banks and everything
getting built up here.

1651
01:16:31,621 --> 01:16:34,589
This is the financial
center for central America.

1652
01:16:34,591 --> 01:16:37,959
So it was fitting that we
establish ourselves here as well.

1653
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:41,329
Still setting up the office.

1654
01:16:41,331 --> 01:16:43,431
We've been here for two weeks.

1655
01:16:43,433 --> 01:16:44,832
We're getting walls put in.

1656
01:16:44,834 --> 01:16:46,567
We've got furniture.

1657
01:16:46,569 --> 01:16:48,836
<i>This is the brains of the operation.</i>

1658
01:16:48,838 --> 01:16:51,305
- <i> This is Mr. Ira.</i>
- Howdy.

1659
01:16:51,307 --> 01:16:54,241
He can program anything, and you can
see all these books he's reading.

1660
01:16:54,243 --> 01:16:57,645
What have we got here?
We've got "cryptanalysis."

1661
01:16:57,647 --> 01:16:59,647
We've got "everyday cryptography,"

1662
01:16:59,649 --> 01:17:03,351
"introduction to mathematical cryptography."

1663
01:17:03,353 --> 01:17:05,753
I read all of these, of course,
when I was much younger,

1664
01:17:05,755 --> 01:17:07,722
but Ira's trying to catch up with me.

1665
01:17:13,328 --> 01:17:15,329
<i>The Bitcoin phenomenon is trying</i>

1666
01:17:15,331 --> 01:17:17,331
<i>to take control of money away</i>

1667
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:19,767
<i>from the state and return it to individuals.</i>

1668
01:17:19,769 --> 01:17:21,335
It's trying to separate money and state

1669
01:17:21,337 --> 01:17:23,337
in the same way and for the same reasons

1670
01:17:23,339 --> 01:17:25,439
<i>that it was important to
separate church and state.</i>

1671
01:17:25,441 --> 01:17:29,076
<i>There's a wonderful quote from
one of the Rothschilds--</i>

1672
01:17:29,078 --> 01:17:30,811
<i>"give me control of a nation's money</i>

1673
01:17:30,813 --> 01:17:32,913
<i>and I care not who makes its laws."</i>

1674
01:17:32,915 --> 01:17:35,216
<i>So I'm trying to play my part
in that narrative.</i>

1675
01:17:36,785 --> 01:17:38,319
<i>Outside of the United States,</i>

1676
01:17:38,321 --> 01:17:40,287
<i>billions of people don't have access</i>

1677
01:17:40,289 --> 01:17:42,256
<i>to basic banking services.</i>

1678
01:17:42,258 --> 01:17:44,158
<i>Bitcoin can level the playing field</i>

1679
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:45,459
<i>and help bring developing nations</i>

1680
01:17:45,461 --> 01:17:46,861
<i>into the global economy.</i>

1681
01:17:54,803 --> 01:17:56,270
Cheers, cheers.

1682
01:17:59,141 --> 01:18:01,542
<i>Eventually people are going
to use a currency</i>

1683
01:18:01,544 --> 01:18:03,310
<i>that is as free as the Internet</i>

1684
01:18:03,312 --> 01:18:05,813
<i>because people will seek out
freedom wherever they can.</i>

1685
01:18:05,815 --> 01:18:07,948
<i>And just as the government
can't stop the Internet</i>

1686
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:11,285
<i>and the freedom of speech, it can't stop
Bitcoin and the freedom of money.</i>

1687
01:18:11,287 --> 01:18:14,121
<i>So we're just gonna have to see
how hard they try to do it.</i>

1688
01:18:14,123 --> 01:18:15,923
It's scary but it's exciting,

1689
01:18:15,925 --> 01:18:18,659
because at the other end
freedom typically wins.

1690
01:18:18,661 --> 01:18:20,961
<i>We just have see how long it
takes to get there.</i>

1691
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:42,850
<i>As summer rolled on,</i>

1692
01:18:42,852 --> 01:18:45,586
<i>the Bitcoin industry continued to flourish.</i>

1693
01:18:45,588 --> 01:18:46,954
It's hard to remember the days where I was

1694
01:18:46,956 --> 01:18:48,589
running this thing out of my basement

1695
01:18:48,591 --> 01:18:49,857
and with one or two people.

1696
01:18:49,859 --> 01:18:52,793
Bitlnstant was just a domain name.

1697
01:18:52,795 --> 01:18:54,428
<i>Charlie and Bitlnstant</i>

01:18:54,430 --> 01:18:56,030

1699
01:18:56,032 --> 01:18:58,265
I always wonder if Satoshi knew

1700
01:18:58,267 --> 01:19:00,634
that he was gonna build
something that would foster

1701
01:19:00,636 --> 01:19:02,803
companies like this,

1702
01:19:02,805 --> 01:19:05,573
<i>where we're actually like
a company with jobs</i>

1703
01:19:05,575 --> 01:19:08,476
based on something that someone
we don't know wrote a paper on.

1704
01:19:08,478 --> 01:19:10,344
It's kind of creepy if you think about it.

1705
01:19:10,346 --> 01:19:12,847
I wonder if he's watching
us right now or something.

1706
01:19:14,382 --> 01:19:15,816
<i>In San Francisco,</i>

1707
01:19:15,818 --> 01:19:17,651
<i>Jered and Tradehill had moved</i>

1708
01:19:17,653 --> 01:19:20,121
<i>into their new space as well.</i>

1709
01:19:20,123 --> 01:19:22,456
It sounds funny. It's not a
$100-million Market anymore.

1710
01:19:22,458 --> 01:19:24,058
It's grown beyond that.

1711
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:26,560
<i>More professional people are in the space</i>

1712
01:19:26,562 --> 01:19:29,163

1713
01:19:29,165 --> 01:19:31,265
<i>But just as things were ramping up,</i>

1714
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:33,968
<i>regulators started taking a
closer look at Bitcoin.</i>

1715
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:38,773
Some bad news for Bitcoin, or is it?

1716
01:19:38,775 --> 01:19:40,608
Its days of glory could be ending.

1717
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:42,042
At least two dozen companies

1718
01:19:42,044 --> 01:19:43,577
have been subpoenaed by New York's

1719
01:19:43,579 --> 01:19:45,412
department of financial services.

1720
01:19:45,414 --> 01:19:46,814
Can't be a good thing.

1721
01:19:46,816 --> 01:19:50,251
<i>Bitlnstant, BitPay, Coinbase</i>

1722
01:19:50,253 --> 01:19:53,921
<i>and Winklevoss capital were
all issued subpoenas.</i>

1723
01:19:53,923 --> 01:19:56,157
We want to make sure that
as this enterprise grows

1724
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:58,125
and if it does become a place where

1725
01:19:58,127 --> 01:20:00,427
a lot of people are engaging
in financial transactions

1726
01:20:00,429 --> 01:20:03,264
that we have sufficient
protections in place.

1727
01:20:03,266 --> 01:20:05,933
<i>With increased pressure in
banking compliance issues,</i>

1728
01:20:05,935 --> 01:20:08,736
<i>Bitlnstant was forced to suspend services.</i>

1729
01:20:15,744 --> 01:20:17,745
<i>Jered faced similar battles.</i>

1730
01:20:17,747 --> 01:20:20,080
<i>Due to a lack of regulation,</i>

1731
01:20:20,082 --> 01:20:23,717
<i>many banks decided to cut ties
with Bitcoin companies.</i>

1732
01:20:23,719 --> 01:20:25,653
<i>Without a U.S. bank account</i>

1733
01:20:25,655 --> 01:20:27,555
<i>Tradehill can't operate,</i>

1734
01:20:27,557 --> 01:20:29,156
<i>and Jered was forced to pull the plug.</i>

1735
01:20:34,095 --> 01:20:36,797
Regulation typically evolves

1736
01:20:36,799 --> 01:20:38,966
much more slowly than innovation.

1737
01:20:38,968 --> 01:20:41,101
And regulations cannot keep pace

1738
01:20:41,103 --> 01:20:42,369
with the pace of innovation.

1739
01:20:43,772 --> 01:20:45,472
<i>Explaining Bitcoin to a bank</i>

1740
01:20:45,474 --> 01:20:47,174
feels like explaining Amazon. Com

1742
01:20:49,078 --> 01:20:51,212

<i>are left out on a limb.</i>

1745
01:20:56,384 --> 01:20:59,887
Banks do not want to bank Bitcoin companies.

1746
01:20:59,889 --> 01:21:01,622
When you have regulation,
you can comply with it.

1747
01:21:01,624 --> 01:21:04,525
When you don't have any regulation,
they're not exactly sure.

1748
01:21:04,527 --> 01:21:07,561
And if the banks aren't sure,
they just default to "no."

1749
01:21:07,563 --> 01:21:11,365
New regulation takes at
least one year to develop

1750
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:13,234
propose and adopt.

1751
01:21:13,236 --> 01:21:14,635
And in many cases,

1752
01:21:14,637 --> 01:21:16,103
it can take much longer than that.

<i>I won't let this go.</i>

01:21:20,743 --> 01:21:23,210
<i>I will fight till the end for Bitcoin.</i>

1755
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:25,546
Whether I have to work on
the street or sell lemonade,

1756
01:21:25,548 --> 01:21:27,281
Bitcoin's gonna succeed one way or another

1757
01:21:27,283 --> 01:21:28,483
and I'm gonna be a part of it.

1758
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:37,091
<i>Over the past several months</i>

1759
01:21:37,093 --> 01:21:40,060
<i>the Bitcoin mining landscape has
changed significantly</i>

1760
01:21:46,601 --> 01:21:48,168
<i>When I started,</i>

1761
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:50,271
<i>Bitcoin mining was a hobby for geeks.</i>

1762
01:21:50,273 --> 01:21:52,339
<i>Now it's big business.</i>

1763
01:21:52,341 --> 01:21:54,308
<i>In order to continue mining</i>

1764
01:21:54,310 --> 01:21:55,843
and continue playing in the game

1765
01:21:55,845 --> 01:21:57,244
and be competitive and be profitable,

1766
01:21:57,246 --> 01:21:58,913
<i>I would have to spend</i>

1767
01:21:58,915 --> 01:22:00,681
<i>hundreds of thousands of dollars on gear.</i>

1768
01:22:02,284 --> 01:22:04,251
<i>The 18 miners I ordered from Avalon</i>

1769
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:06,020
<i>never arrived.</i>

1770
01:22:06,022 --> 01:22:08,155
<i>And the units from butterfly labs</i>

1771
01:22:08,157 --> 01:22:10,190
<i>took over a year to ship.</i>

1772
01:22:10,192 --> 01:22:12,326
<i>By the time I got them,</i>

1773
01:22:12,328 --> 01:22:14,428
<i>Bitcoin mining was so competitive,</i>

1774
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:15,930
<i>that I would never be able to mine back</i>

1775
01:22:15,932 --> 01:22:18,465
<i>all the coins I used to buy them.</i>

1776
01:22:18,467 --> 01:22:20,768
See that computer?
That computer makes Bitcoins.

1777
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:24,538
And this is all the other computers
that are making Bitcoins too,

1778
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:27,741
<i>and it goes straight up in a
line up in the air.</i>

1779
01:22:27,743 --> 01:22:29,076
And that's 'cause there's a lot people

1780
01:22:29,078 --> 01:22:31,979
that are making Bitcoins
with computers like that.

1781
01:22:31,981 --> 01:22:33,948
<i>As my new units are arriving,</i>

1782
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:35,549
<i>I'm selling them for Bitcoins</i>

1783
01:22:35,551 --> 01:22:36,984
<i>to try to recoup what I can.</i>

1784
01:22:36,986 --> 01:22:38,752
If you don't mind grabbing
those other cables,

1785
01:22:38,754 --> 01:22:40,521
- I'm not coming back up.
- <i> Okay.</i>

1786
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:43,477
<i>I'm taking a pretty big hit...</i>

1787
01:22:44,592 --> 01:22:46,260
<i>But overall the mining experience</i>

1788
01:22:46,262 --> 01:22:47,528
<i>has still been worth it.</i>

1789
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:53,600
<i>My mining days may be over,</i>

1790
01:22:53,602 --> 01:22:55,803
<i>but I'm still very involved with Bitcoin.</i>

1791
01:22:55,805 --> 01:22:57,972
With Bitcoin, it's a money system where

1792
01:22:57,974 --> 01:23:01,041
it's backed by math.
It's back by the laws of mathematics

1793
01:23:01,043 --> 01:23:02,743
and by the rules of the protocol.

1794
01:23:02,745 --> 01:23:04,745
I keep thinking that there's
gotta be an easier way

1795
01:23:04,747 --> 01:23:06,447
to just set up a secondary protocol

1796
01:23:06,449 --> 01:23:08,415
to trade private keys.

1797
01:23:08,417 --> 01:23:10,751
Every time I log on,
I see another dot on China

1798
01:23:10,753 --> 01:23:13,420

now the price has gone up.

1799
01:23:13,422 --> 01:23:16,557
<i>The price is nearing 150 again.</i>

1800
01:23:16,559 --> 01:23:18,492
<i>Many attribute it to the explosion</i>

1801
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:20,894
<i>of Bitcoin's popularity in China.</i>

1802
01:23:20,896 --> 01:23:22,663
What's happened recently is Chinese people

1803
01:23:22,665 --> 01:23:23,998
have really come and adopted Bitcoin.

1804
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,834
<i>As a culture, as a nation</i>

1805
01:23:26,836 --> 01:23:28,836
<i>Chinese people are keen to learn about</i>

<i>things that involve math and science.</i>

1808
01:23:32,608 --> 01:23:35,409
<i>We think that China can really
contribute in this space</i>

1809
01:23:35,411 --> 01:23:37,644
and help bring Bitcoin to the mainstream.

1810
01:23:37,646 --> 01:23:39,780
<i>Germany's another part of the world</i>

1811
01:23:39,782 --> 01:23:41,415

01:23:41,417 --> 01:23:43,884
<i>It's starting to get normal

<i>comes in and buys a coffee with Bitcoins.</i>

1814
01:23:46,288 --> 01:23:49,223
People are looking for a new way of paying--

1815
01:23:49,225 --> 01:23:50,824
Not through banks, not with Euros,

1816
01:23:50,826 --> 01:23:52,066
not with dollars. Something new.

1817
01:23:53,795 --> 01:23:55,829
<i>The German ministry of finance</i>

1818
01:23:55,831 --> 01:23:57,931
<i>even became the first governing body</i>

1819
01:23:57,933 --> 01:24:00,567
<i>to officially classify Bitcoin as
"private money."</i>

1820
01:24:00,569 --> 01:24:02,703
I believe if we want to get

1821
01:24:02,705 --> 01:24:04,772
some justice back into our society,

1822
01:24:04,774 --> 01:24:07,741
<i>we should reduce the
importance of the banks.</i>

1823
01:24:07,743 --> 01:24:10,778
<i>Bitcoin is banking without banks,</i>

1824
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:11,780
so here we go.

1825
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:17,885
The FBI today shut down what it's calling

01:24:44,313 --> 01:24:46,213
Media has always tied the silk road to it,

1839
01:24:46,215 --> 01:24:49,716
as if silk road is Bitcoin, but it's not.

1840
01:24:49,718 --> 01:24:52,619
<i>This may be a sign that
Bitcoin is growing up.</i>

1841
01:24:52,621 --> 01:24:54,655
It's funny. My friend

01:24:54,657 --> 01:24:55,989
"silk road got raided

01:24:59,395 --> 01:25:02,262
Is there a way to invalidate Bitcoins?"

1845
01:25:02,264 --> 01:25:04,131
I replied, "no."

1846
01:25:11,573 --> 01:25:13,107
People are starting to finally realize

1847
01:25:13,109 --> 01:25:15,909
that Bitcoin has nothing to
do with how people use it.

1848
01:25:15,911 --> 01:25:17,411
It's just money. It's like gold.

1849
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:20,781
<i>Of course, not everyone thinks</i>

1850
01:25:20,783 --> 01:25:23,016
<i>Bitcoin is the way of the future.</i>

1851
01:25:23,018 --> 01:25:24,751
<i>Bitcoin will not be able</i>

1854
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:31,558
I don't see it

1855
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,827

1861
01:25:44,106 --> 01:25:47,474

1865
01:25:52,815 --> 01:25:54,915
<i>we'll look back on this and
just kind of chuckle</i>

1866
01:25:54,917 --> 01:25:57,284
<i>at the Bitcoin fad.</i>

1867
01:25:57,286 --> 01:25:59,486
"Oh yeah, I remember Bitcoin.

1868
01:25:59,488 --> 01:26:02,556
Oh yeah, I remember that."

1869
01:26:02,558 --> 01:26:04,024
It's financial freedom.

1870
01:26:04,026 --> 01:26:06,393
Come on, bro. This is the new world, bro.

1871
01:26:06,395 --> 01:26:08,195
<i>Others are more optimistic.</i>

1872
01:26:08,197 --> 01:26:09,963
I think within 10 years,

1873
01:26:09,965 --> 01:26:12,065
you're gonna have a lot
of people using Bitcoin,

1874
01:26:12,067 --> 01:26:13,734
but they're not gonna realize
that they're using it,

1875
01:26:13,736 --> 01:26:15,802
because it's gonna be a protocol
that's imbedded underneath

1876
01:26:15,804 --> 01:26:17,971
whatever financial service
they're using today.

1877
01:26:17,973 --> 01:26:19,973
<i>And by Bitcoin being open-source</i>

1878
01:26:19,975 --> 01:26:21,875
<i>it's what can allow all these
different mobile wallets</i>

1879
01:26:21,877 --> 01:26:23,443
<i>and all these financial technologies</i>

1880
01:26:23,445 --> 01:26:24,645
<i>to all talk to each other,</i>

1881
01:26:24,647 --> 01:26:27,047
especially around the world.

1882
01:26:27,049 --> 01:26:28,649
<i>Whoever the hell Satoshi was,</i>

1883
01:26:28,651 --> 01:26:31,084
<i>he should go down in history as
one of the greatest people</i>

1884
01:26:31,086 --> 01:26:32,719
<i>or groups of people that ever existed.</i>

1885
01:26:32,721 --> 01:26:34,955
This is a technology that mankind has needed

1886
01:26:34,957 --> 01:26:36,490
for thousands of years.

1887
01:26:36,492 --> 01:26:38,825
People have been dealing
with monetary shenanigans

1888
01:26:38,827 --> 01:26:41,628
since the Roman empire clipping gold coins.

1889
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:43,897
And finally people can escape it.

1890
01:26:43,899 --> 01:26:47,634
I'm cautious to try to predict the future.

1891
01:26:47,636 --> 01:26:49,069
<i>We don't really know.</i>

1892
01:26:49,071 --> 01:26:51,705
<i>I tend to be a technological optimist.</i>

1893
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:53,974
I see the democratization of technology

1894
01:26:53,976 --> 01:26:55,709
as being a really positive thing.

1895
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:59,646
<i>And I think that's a really powerful force</i>

1896
01:26:59,648 --> 01:27:01,515
<i>that is really only just beginning.</i>

1897
01:27:26,007 --> 01:27:28,175
Not bad. Oh!

1898
01:27:39,221 --> 01:27:42,356
Recently, as the price has
been floating around 200 again,

1899
01:27:42,358 --> 01:27:45,058
I have a lot of friends that have asked me,

1900
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:48,462
"are you gonna cash out
some of your Bitcoins now?

1901
01:27:48,464 --> 01:27:51,865
The price is really high.
You should get some dollars out of it."

1902
01:27:51,867 --> 01:27:54,935
I kind of tell 'em, "no, don't you see it?"

1903
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:58,572
<i>I've met so many interesting people</i>

1904
01:27:58,574 --> 01:28:00,407
and there seems to be one
thing that kind of binds

1905
01:28:00,409 --> 01:28:02,709
a lot of them together, and that is that

1906
01:28:02,711 --> 01:28:05,145
they're willing to face opposition

1907
01:28:05,147 --> 01:28:07,267
<i>and follow through on the ideas
that they believe in.</i>

1908
01:28:08,483 --> 01:28:10,250
<i>The people who try the crazy ideas</i>

1909
01:28:10,252 --> 01:28:12,919
<i>often fail and then everybody likes
to point their fingers</i>

1910
01:28:12,921 --> 01:28:15,055
<i>and laugh and say,
"that was such a stupid idea."</i>

1911
01:28:15,057 --> 01:28:17,557
<i>But once in a while it works out.</i>

1912
01:28:17,559 --> 01:28:19,559
<i>I think Bitcoin is proving to be</i>

1913
01:28:19,561 --> 01:28:20,961
<i>one of those things.</i>

1914
01:28:28,102 --> 01:28:29,836
The decision to bring virtual currency

1915
01:28:29,838 --> 01:28:31,938
within the scope of our regulatory framework

1916
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:33,073
should be viewed as

1917
01:28:33,075 --> 01:28:34,941
a positive development for this sector.

1918
01:28:34,943 --> 01:28:36,643
I'm here to testify, because I believe

1919
01:28:36,645 --> 01:28:38,812
that digital currency represents

1920
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:40,714
one of the most important technical

1921
01:28:40,716 --> 01:28:42,749
and economic innovations of our time.

1922
01:28:42,751 --> 01:28:45,652
We are enthusiastic about the potential

1923
01:28:45,654 --> 01:28:46,887
of virtual currencies

1924
01:28:46,889 --> 01:28:48,989
and the digital economy for social good.

1925
01:28:53,594 --> 01:28:56,196
This latest generation of technology

1926
01:28:56,198 --> 01:28:57,731
which we're talking about today

1927
01:28:57,733 --> 01:29:00,200
takes things to a whole new level.

1928
01:29:00,202 --> 01:29:01,768
There's a bit

1929
01:29:01,770 --> 01:29:03,136
of a shared responsibility here

1930
01:29:03,138 --> 01:29:04,871
in trying to figure out
how to make this work.

1931
01:29:04,873 --> 01:29:07,541
It is a little strange that Bitcoin--

1932
01:29:07,543 --> 01:29:08,809
We don't know who the creator is

1933
01:29:08,811 --> 01:29:11,745
and so that often

1934
01:29:11,747 --> 01:29:13,113
conjures up the idea that there's

1935
01:29:13,115 --> 01:29:14,781
some risk here that we have not--

1936
01:29:14,783 --> 01:29:16,183
You don't think it was Al Gore, do you?

1937
01:29:19,787 --> 01:29:21,288
If you think a little broadly,

1938
01:29:21,290 --> 01:29:23,757
this could, again,
have huge huge implications.

1939
01:29:33,935 --> 01:29:37,237
<i>2013 was the year Bitcoin first
entered the mainstream</i>

1940
01:29:37,239 --> 01:29:40,741
<i>and 2014 got off to a dramatic start.</i>

1941
01:29:40,743 --> 01:29:43,243
<i>Just as we were wrapping
things up on our film,</i>

1942
01:29:43,245 --> 01:29:45,112
<i>Charlie Shrem was arrested</i>

1943
01:29:45,114 --> 01:29:48,148
<i>after returning from a Bitcoin
conference in Amsterdam.</i>

1944
01:29:48,150 --> 01:29:51,151
<i>He could be facing up to 30 years in prison</i>

1945
01:29:51,153 --> 01:29:53,787
<i>on charges related to his
activities at Bitlnstant.</i>

1946
01:29:57,925 --> 01:30:00,560
In J.F.K., you walk right off the plane,

1947
01:30:00,562 --> 01:30:02,796
and you go straight to customs.

1948
01:30:02,798 --> 01:30:04,698
About three agents in front of me

1949
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:06,800
and then four agents behind me said,

1950
01:30:06,802 --> 01:30:08,702
"Mr. Shrem, please come with us."

1951
01:30:08,704 --> 01:30:11,271
<i>They took me to an interrogating room,</i>

1952
01:30:11,273 --> 01:30:12,873
<i>told me that I'm being arrested</i>

1953
01:30:12,875 --> 01:30:15,108
<i>on federal crimes of money laundering,</i>

1954
01:30:15,110 --> 01:30:17,110
<i>running an unlicensed money
transmission business</i>

1955
01:30:17,112 --> 01:30:20,781
<i>and failing to file
suspicious-activity reports.</i>

1956
01:30:20,783 --> 01:30:23,884
<i>The indictment alleged that
Charlie had sold Bitcoins</i>

1957
01:30:23,886 --> 01:30:26,520
<i>to a reseller that operated
on the silk road.</i>

1958
01:30:27,555 --> 01:30:29,623
What sucks is the house arrest.

1959
01:30:29,625 --> 01:30:33,059
I have to pretty much be here all the time,
every day. I can't even go outside

1960
01:30:33,061 --> 01:30:35,822
unless I'm going to my lawyer's office,
which is once or twice a week.

1961
01:30:36,597 --> 01:30:38,365
<i>I pretty much lost my freedom,</i>

1962
01:30:38,367 --> 01:30:40,447
<i>lost everything that I've built
over the past year.</i>

1963
01:30:43,204 --> 01:30:45,405
<i>Charlie's arrest wasn't the only bad news</i>

1964
01:30:45,407 --> 01:30:48,074
<i>that rocked the community in the new year.</i>

1965
01:30:48,076 --> 01:30:51,178
<i>For months there had been rumors that Mt.
Gox had become insolvent.</i>

1966
01:30:51,180 --> 01:30:54,881
<i>And in February the site went offline.</i>

1967
01:30:57,352 --> 01:30:58,832
Do you still have everyone's Bitcoins?

1968
01:31:01,856 --> 01:31:03,757
I'm not touching you. I haven't touched you.

1969
01:31:03,759 --> 01:31:06,293
Do you still have everyone's Bitcoins?

1970
01:31:14,036 --> 01:31:15,368
<i>The rumors turned out to be true.</i>

1971
01:31:33,621 --> 01:31:35,889
<i>Mt. Gox had reportedly been hacked</i>

1972
01:31:35,891 --> 01:31:38,892
<i>and nearly half a billion dollars
worth of Bitcoin were missing.</i>

1973
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:45,632
<i>Mark was forced to step down as C.E.O.</i>

1974
01:31:45,634 --> 01:31:47,801
<i>And Mt. Gox went into bankruptcy.</i>

1975
01:31:54,375 --> 01:31:56,977
A national magazine
claims to have identified

1976
01:31:56,979 --> 01:31:58,712
the mysterious founder of the worldwide

1977
01:31:58,714 --> 01:32:00,614
digital currency called Bitcoin.

1978
01:32:00,616 --> 01:32:02,115
<i>Tonight he is speaking out,</i>

1979
01:32:02,117 --> 01:32:03,450
<i>but he says he has</i>

1980
01:32:03,452 --> 01:32:04,951
<i>nothing whatsoever to do with Bitcoin.</i>

1981
01:32:04,953 --> 01:32:06,887
<i>Why did you create Bitcoin, sir?</i>

1982
01:32:06,889 --> 01:32:07,954
Okay.

1983
01:32:11,226 --> 01:32:12,792
Man *2: <i>Sir, can we ask you about Bitcoin?</i>

1984
01:32:12,794 --> 01:32:14,027
- No no no no no.
- <i> Why were you involved in Bitcoin?</i>

1985
01:32:14,029 --> 01:32:17,564
Okay, I'm not involved in Bitcoin, okay?

1986
01:32:17,566 --> 01:32:18,698
- <i> Who's involved in it?</i>
- Wait a minute.

1987
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:19,966
I want a free lunch first.

1988
01:32:19,968 --> 01:32:21,368
I'm gonna go with this guy.

1989
01:32:22,737 --> 01:32:25,872
I want a big one. Yeah.

1990
01:32:25,874 --> 01:32:27,908
Oh, okay. Yeah, this will be good.

1991
01:32:27,910 --> 01:32:30,744
- Oh jeez.
- We have some water.

1992
01:32:30,746 --> 01:32:33,079
Hey, where's yours?

1993
01:32:33,081 --> 01:32:36,182
<i>"Newsweek" claimed the creator of Bitcoin</i>

1994
01:32:36,184 --> 01:32:38,218
<i>had not used a pseudonym.</i>

1995
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:39,953
<i>They connected the dots</i>

1996
01:32:39,955 --> 01:32:41,955
<i>to a 64-year-old Japanese man</i>

1997
01:32:41,957 --> 01:32:44,057
<i>living in Los Angeles...</i>

1998
01:32:44,059 --> 01:32:47,527
<i>Named Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto.</i>

1999
01:32:48,930 --> 01:32:51,464
<i>Nakamoto immediately denied the allegations</i>

2000
01:32:51,466 --> 01:32:53,800
<i>and said he'd tell his story
to the first reporter</i>

2001
01:32:53,802 --> 01:32:55,602
<i>who agreed to buy him lunch.</i>

2002
01:32:55,604 --> 01:32:57,437
The main reason I'm here is

2003
01:32:57,439 --> 01:33:00,240
to clear my name, that I have nothing

2004
01:33:00,242 --> 01:33:02,142
- to do with Bitcoin...
- Yup.

2005
01:33:02,144 --> 01:33:04,911
...nothing to do with developing.

2006
01:33:04,913 --> 01:33:08,114
I was just an engineer doing something else.

2007
01:33:08,116 --> 01:33:10,350
<i>As the media frenzy escalated,</i>

2008
01:33:10,352 --> 01:33:13,186
<i>"Newsweek's" claims started to unravel.</i>

2009
01:33:13,188 --> 01:33:15,922
<i>Holes in the story led many to believe</i>

2010
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:17,924
<i>it was nothing more than
sensational journalism.</i>

2011
01:33:19,393 --> 01:33:21,094
<i>There was no conclusive evidence</i>

2012
01:33:21,096 --> 01:33:22,762
<i>tying Dorian to Bitcoin.</i>

01:33:24,365 --> 01:33:25,899
<i>Amidst the uncertainty,</i>

No, you buy it. But 100k right now.

2031
01:34:38,206 --> 01:34:40,874
Dude, I can't. I need the
floating Gox for volume.

2032
01:34:40,876 --> 01:34:44,044
Closing bell for Satoshi square!

01:34:44,046 --> 01:34:45,145
All right, does this look right?

2034
01:34:45,147 --> 01:34:46,579
1-n-p-w? Yup.

2035
01:34:46,581 --> 01:34:48,048
Yup, okay.

2036
01:34:48,050 --> 01:34:49,050
And I owe you 0.2?

2037
01:34:49,051 --> 01:34:51,317
- Uh... 0.18.
- 0.18.

2038
01:34:51,319 --> 01:34:54,654
This is for Bitcoin t-shirt.

2039
01:34:54,656 --> 01:34:56,823
I got 'em. A pleasure, sir.

2040
01:34:56,825 --> 01:34:58,324
Great doing business with you.

2041
01:34:58,326 --> 01:35:00,427
- Gonna wear your shirt proudly.
- Do it.

2042
01:35:00,429 --> 01:35:02,128
That's one thing that's
interesting about Bitcoin.

2043
01:35:02,130 --> 01:35:04,197
It's like, how do you declare losses?

2044
01:35:04,199 --> 01:35:06,766
You point to two transactions
that happened on the Internet

2045
01:35:06,768 --> 01:35:09,069
and you tell the I.R.S. That you owned that?

2046
01:35:09,071 --> 01:35:11,438
"Oh, I used to own that and
I lost the private key."

2047
01:35:12,707 --> 01:35:14,374
And then if you really do lose it,

2048
01:35:14,376 --> 01:35:16,376
how do you write it off for taxes?

2049
01:35:16,378 --> 01:35:18,044
Oh, that's gonna be interesting.

2050
01:35:22,283 --> 01:35:24,584
We love Bitcoin.

2051
01:35:24,586 --> 01:35:27,020
Okay, guys, we're gonna play a
special version of hopscotch

2052
01:35:27,022 --> 01:35:30,290
called "Bitcoin blockchain hopscotch."

2053
01:35:30,292 --> 01:35:33,126
Oh, you lost all your Bitcoins!

2054
01:35:34,730 --> 01:35:36,596
<i>Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?</i>

2055
01:35:38,266 --> 01:35:41,234
I'd... rather not tell you,

2056
01:35:41,236 --> 01:35:42,602
- but yeah.
- <i> Oh, do you know?</i>

2057
01:35:42,604 --> 01:35:45,338
Uh, maybe not, maybe.

2058
01:35:45,340 --> 01:35:46,906
<i>Oh. </i>

2059
01:35:46,908 --> 01:35:49,776
You know, I have a Bitcoin
and a half myself now.

2060
01:35:49,778 --> 01:35:51,578
Which I think probably in 10 years

2061
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:57,083
<i>When you think about it hard enough</i>

2062
01:35:57,085 --> 01:35:59,452
<i>on a global scale, this is a
net gain for humanity.</i>
